# The Student entity.

* Create a *Models* folder in the project folder.
* Create `Models/Student.cs` with the below code:

```cs
namespace ContosoUniversity.Models
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public DateTime EnrollmentDAte { get; set; }

        public ICollection<Enrollment> Enrollments { get; set }
    }
}
```
The `ID` property becomes the primary key column of the database table that corresponds to this class. By default, EF Core interpretes a property that is named `ID` or `classnameID` as the primary key. 
So the alternative automatically recognized name for the `Student` class primary key is `StudentID`.

The `Enrollments` property is a navigation property. Navigation properties hold other entities that are related to this entity. In this case, the `Enrollments` property of a `Student` entity holds all of the `Enrollment` entities that are related to that Student. E.g, if a Student row in the database has two related Enrollment rows, the `Enrollment` navigation property contains those two Enrollments entities.

In the database, an Enrollment row is related to a Student row if its `StudentID` column contains the student's ID valvue. E.g, suppose a Student row has ID = 1. Related Enrollment rows will have `StudentID` = 1. `StudentID` is a *foreign key* in the Enrollment table.

The `Enrollment` property is defined as `ICollection<Enrollment>` because there may be multiple related Enrollment entities. Other collection types can be used, such as `List<Enrollment>` or `HashSet<Enrollment>`. When `ICollection<Enrollment>` is used, EF Core creates a `HashSet<Enrollment>` collection by default.

Create `Models/Enrollment.cs` with the following code:

```cs
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

namespace ContosoUniversity.Models
{
    public enum Grade
    {
        A, B, C, D, F
    }
    public class Enrollment
    {
        public int EnrollmentID { get; set; }
        public int CourseID { get; set; }
        public int StudentID { get; set; }
        [DisplayFormat(NullDisplayText = "No grade")]
        public Grade? Grade { get; set; }

        public Course Course { get; set; }
        public Student Student { get; set; }
    }
}
```
The `EnrollmentID` property is the primary key; this entity uses the `classnameID` pattern instead of `ID` by itself. For a production data model, many developers choose one pattern and use it consistently. This tutorial uses both just to illustrate that both work. Using `ID` without `classname` makes it easier to implement some kinds of data model changes.

The `Grade` property is an `enum`. The question mark after the `Grade` type declaration indicates that the `Grade` property is [nullable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/). A grade that's null is different from a zero grade-null means a grade isn't known or hasn't been assigned yet.

The `StudentID` property is a foreign key, and the corresponding navigation property is `Student`. An `Enrollment` entity is associated with one `Student` entity, so the property contains a single `Student` entity.

The `CourseID` property is a foreign key, and the corresponding navigation property is `Course`. An `Enrollment` entity is associated with one `Course` entity.

EF Core interprets a property as a foreign key if it's named `<navigation property name>` `<primary key property name`. E.g, `StudentID` is the foreign key for the `Student` navigation property, since the `Student` entity's primary key is `ID`. Foreign key properties can also be named `<primary key property name>`. E.g, `CourseID` since the `Course` entity's primary key is `CourseID`.

# The Course entity.

Create `Models/Course.cs` with the following code:

```cs
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;

namespace ContosoUniversity.Models
{
    public class Course
    {
        [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.None)]
        public int CourseID { get; set; }
        public string Title { get; set; }
        public int Credits { get; set; }

        public ICollection<Enrollment> Enrollments { get; set; }

    }
}
```

The `Enrollment` property is a navigation property. A `Course` entity can be related to any number of `Enrollment` entities.

The `DatabaseGenerated` attribute alllows the app to specify the primary key rather than having the database generate it.

Build the app. The compiler generates several warnings about how `null` values are handled. See: [Tutorials:Express_your_design_intent_more_clearly_with_nullable_and_non-nullable_types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/nullable-reference-types) for more information.

To eliminate the warnings from nullable refernce types, remove the following line from the `ContosoUniversity.csproj` file:

```xml
<Nullable>enable</Nullable>
```
The scaffolding engine currently does not support [nullable reference types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references), therefore the models used in scaffold can't either.

Remove the `?` nullable reference type annotation from `public string? RequestId { get; set; }` in `Pages/Error.cshtml.cs` so the project builds without compiler warnings.
