# Understand tag helpers and page handlers
Tag helpers are a special kind of HTML element that can contain C# code.
Page handlers are methods that handle browser requests.

## Tag Helpers
Tag helpers are used to address the inefficiencies of context switching between HTML and C#. Most of ASP.NET Core's built-in Tag helpers extend standard HTML elements. Tag helpers provide extra server-side attributes for HTML elements, making the elements more robust.

There are four tag helpers you should know for this project:
1. **Partial**
2. **Label**
3. **Input**
4. **Validation Summary Message**

### Partial Tag Helper

```cshtml
<partial name="_ValidationScriptsPartial" />
```
This injects the contents of the _ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml file into a page. The _ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml file contains JavaScript that's used to validate form input, so it needs to be included on every page that contains a form.

### Label Tag Helper

```cshtml
<label asp-for="Foo.Id" class="control-label"></label>
```
This extends the standard HTML `<label>` element. As is common for many tag helpers, it uses an `asp-for` attribute. The attribute accepts a property from the `PageModel`. In this case, the name of the `PageModel`'s `Foo.Id` property (specifically, the string `"Id"`) will be rendered as the content for an HTML `<label>` element.

### Input Tag Helper

```cshtml
<input asp-for="Foo.Id" class="form-control" />
```
Similar to the previous example, this extends the standard HTML `<input>` element. It also uses an `asp-for` attribute to specify a `PageModel` property. In this case, the value of the `Foo.Id` property will be rendered as the `value` attribute for an HTML `<input>` element.

### Validation Summary Tag Helper

```cshtml
<div asp-validation-summary="All"></div>
```
The Validation Summary Tag Helper displays a validation message for a single property on the model.

```
Things like validation rules and property display names are defined in the `PageModel` class. We'll point out where to find them in the code in the next unit.
```

### Page handlers
The `PageModel` class defines page handlers for **HTTP** requests and data used to render the page. In the previous exercise, the `PizzaListModel` class handled the **HTTP GET** request by setting the value of the `PizzaList` property to the value of `_service.GetPizzas()`.

Common handlers include `OnGet` for page initialization and `OnPost` for form submissions. To handle an HTTP POST, a page handler might verify the user-submitted data, presents the input form page again if invalid, or send the valid data to a service or database for persistence.

In the next unit, you'll add a form to create new pizzas using several tag helpers. You'll also add page handlers to handle the form submission and deletion of pizzas.
