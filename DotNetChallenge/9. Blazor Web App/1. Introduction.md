# Introduction.
Blazor lets C# developers use their skills to build web apps with C# and Microsoft.NET.

Imagine you're building a client-side web app and already have a team of .NET developers. Also, imagine you want to deploy your app as a progressive web application. Users could then download the app and use it offline.

With Blazor, developers can build front-end and back-end logic for web apps with common languages, frameworks, and tools.

Using the same language for front-end and back-end code can:
* Accelerate app development.
* Reduce the complexity of the build pipeline.
* Simplify maintenance.
* Let developers understand and work on both client-side and server-side code.

## Learning objectives.
In this module, you'll:
* Configure your local environment for Blazor development with Visual Studio Code.
* Create a new Blazor project.
* Add a Component to a Blazor Page.
* Update logic in a Blazor web app.
* Learn about event handling and data binding in Blazor components.
* Use routing in a Blazor app.
