# Upgrade app dependencies.
1. In the DotNetDependencies.csproj file, look at the `dependencies`. It should look like this code:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Humanizer" Version="2.7.9" />
</ItemGroup>
```

2. To see installed dependencies, run this command:

```.NET CLI
dotnet list package
```

This should output the requested version and the final resolved (installed) version.

```
Top-level Package      Requested   Resolved
> Humanizer            2.7.9        2.7.9
```

3. To see what dependencies are outdated, run this command:

```.NET CLi
dotnet list package --outdated
```

The output should look something like the following output. You might get different values in the Latest column.

```
Project `DotNetDependencies` has the following updates to its packages
   [net6.0]:
   Top-level Package      Requested   Resolved   Latest
   > Humanizer            2.7.9       2.7.9      2.11.10
```

By default, this command will check for the latest stable version. To check for pre-release packages, append `--include-prerelease` to the previous command:

```.NET CLI
dotnet list package --outdated --include-prerelease
```

4. You can, with some level of confidence, update to the `Latest` version. Doing so will ensure the dependencies get the latest features and patches in that major version. To install the latest version, run the following command:

```.NET CLI
dotnet add package Humanizer
```

You should get output similar to the following:

```
info : PackageReference for package 'Humanizer' version '2.11.10' updated in file 'C:\Users\username\Desktop\DotNetDependencies\DotNetDependencies.csproj'.
```

The output states that your project dependencies have been updated.

If you want to upgrade to a specific version of the dependency, you can append the `--version` parameter and specify the specific version.

```.NET CLI
dotnet add package Humanizer --version 2.11.10
```

Lastly, you can also install the latest pre-release package by appending the --prerelease parameter.

```.NET CLI
dotnet add package Humanizer --prerelease
```
