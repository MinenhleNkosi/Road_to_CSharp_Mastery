# Add a Controller
A *controller* is a public class with one or more public methods known as *actions*. By convention, a controller is placed in the project root's Controllers directory. The actions are exposed as *HTTP* endpoints inside the web API controller.

-----
## Create a controller
1. Select the *Controllers* folder in Visual Studio Code and add a new file called *PizzaController.cs*.

![pic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/aspnetcore/build-web-api-aspnet-core/media/add-pizza-controller-file.png)

An empty class file named *PizzaController.cs* is created in the *Controllers* directory. The directory name *Controllers* is a convention. The directory name comes from the *model-view-controller* architecture that the web API uses.

    -----
    Note
    By convention, controller class names are suffixed with *Controller*.
    -----

2. Add the following code to *Controllers/PizzaController.cs*. Save your changes.

```cs
using ContosoPizza.Models;
using ContosoPizza.Services;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace ContosoPizza.Controllers;

[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class PizzaController : ControllerBase
{
    public PizzaController()
    {
    }

    // GET all action

    // GET by Id action

    // POST action

    // PUT action

    // DELETE action
}
```
As you learned previously, this class derives from `ControllerBase`, the base class for working with **HTTP** requests in **ASP.NET** Core. It also includes the two standard attributes you've learned about: `[ApiController]` and `[Route]`. As before, the `[Route]` attribute defines a mapping to the `[controller]` token. Because this controller class is named `PizzaController`, this controller handles requests to `https://localhost:{PORT}/pizza`.

------
## Get all pizzas
The first *REST* verb that you need to implement is `GET`, where a client can get all pizzas from the API. You can use the built-in `[HttpGet]` attribute to define a method that will return the pizzas from our service.

Replace the `// GET all action` comment in *Controllers/PizzaController.cs* with the following code:

```cs
[HttpGet]
public ActionResult<List<Pizza>> GetAll() =>
    PizzaService.GetAll();
```

The preceding action:
* Responds only to the **HTTP** `GET` verb, as denoted by the `[HttpGet]` attribute.
* Returns an `ActionResult` instance of type `List<Pizza>`. The `ActionResult` type is the base class for all action results in **ASP.NET** Core.
* Queries the service for all pizza and automatically returns data with a `Content-Type` value of `application/json`.

-----
## Retrieve a single pizza
The client might also want to request information about a specific pizza instead of the entire list. You can implement another `GET` action that requires an `id` parameter. You can use the built-in `[HttpGet("{id}")]` attribute to define a method that will return the pizzas from our service. The routing logic registers `[HttpGet]` (without `id`) and `[HttpGet("{id}")]` (with `id`) as two different routes. You can then write a separate action to retrieve a single item.

Replace the `// GET by Id action` comment in *Controllers/PizzaController.cs* with the following code:

```cs
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public ActionResult<Pizza> Get(int id)
{
    var pizza = PizzaService.Get(id);

    if(pizza == null)
        return NotFound();

    return pizza;
}
```
The preceding action:
* Responds only to the **HTTP** `GET` verb, as denoted by the `[HttpGet]` attribute.
* Requires that the `id` parameter's value is included in the URL segment after `pizza/`. Remember, the controller-level `[Route]` attribute defined the `/pizza` pattern.
* Queries the database for a pizza that matches the provided `id` parameter.

Each `ActionResult` instance used in the preceding action is mapped to the corresponding **HTTP** status code in the following table:

| **ASP.NET**           | **HTTP status code**  | **Description**                                       |
| **Core Action**       |                       |                                                       |
| **Result**            |                       |                                                       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `OK` is implied       | 200                   | A product that matches the provided `id` parameter    |
|                       |                       | exists in the in-memory cache. The product is         |
|                       |                       | included in the response body in the media type, as   |
|                       |                       | defined in the `accept` HTTP request header (JSON by  |
|                       |                       | default).                                             |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `NotFound`            | 404                   | A product that matches the provided `id` parameter    |
|                       |                       | doesn't exists in the in-memory cache.                |

## Build and test the controller
1. Build and start the web API by running the following command:

```.NET CLI
dotnet run
```

2. Open the existing `httprepl` terminal, or open a new integrated terminal from Visual Studio Code by selecting **Terminal > New Terminal** from the main menu.

3. Connect to our web API by running the following command:

```.NET CLI
httprepl https://localhost:{PORT}
```

Alternatively, run the following command at any time while `httpRepl` is running:

```.NET CLI
connect https://localhost:{port}
```

4. To see the newly available `Pizza` endpoint, run the following command:

```bash
ls
```
The preceding command detects all APIs available on the connected endpoint. It should display the following code:

```Output
https://localhost:{PORT}/> ls
 .                 []
 Pizza             [GET]
 WeatherForecast   [GET]
```

5. Go to the `Pizza` endpoint by running the following command:

```.NET CLI
cd Pizza
```

The preceding command shows an output of available APIs for the `Pizza` endpoint:

```Output
https://localhost:{PORT}/> cd Pizza
/Pizza    [GET]
```

6. Make a `GET` request in `HttpRepl` by using the following command:

```.NET CLI
get
```

The preceding command returns a list of all pizzas in JSON:

```Output
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
  Date: Fri, 02 Apr 2021 21:55:53 GMT
  Server: Kestrel
  Transfer-Encoding: chunked

  [
      {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Classic Italian",
          "isGlutenFree": false
      },
      {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Veggie",
          "isGlutenFree": true
      }
  ]
```

7. To query for a single pizza, you can make another GET request, but pass in an id parameter by using the following command:

```.NET CLI
get 1
```

The preceding command returns Classic Italian with the following output:

```Output
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Fri, 02 Apr 2021 21:57:57 GMT
Server: Kestrel
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Classic Italian",
    "isGlutenFree": false
}
```

8. Our API also handles situations where the item doesn't exist. Call the API again, but pass in an invalid pizza `id` parameter by using the following command:

```.NET CLI
get 5
```

The preceding command returns a `404 Not Found` error with the following output:

```Output
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8
Date: Fri, 02 Apr 2021 22:03:06 GMT
Server: Kestrel
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{
    "type": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.4",
    "title": "Not Found",
    "status": 404,
    "traceId": "00-ec263e401ec554b6a2f3e216a1d1fac5-4b40b8023d56762c-00"
}
```

9. Return to the `dotnet` terminal in the drop-down list in Visual Studio Code and shut down the web API by selecting CTRL+C on your keyboard.

You've now finished implementing the `GET` verbs. In the next unit, you can add more actions to `PizzaController` to support `CRUD` operations on pizza data.
