# Create a web API project
To set up a .NET project to work with the web API, we'll use Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code includes an integrated terminal that makes creating a new project easy.

1. In Visual Studio Code, select **File** > **Open Folder**.
2. Create a new folder named **ContosoPizza** in the location of your choice, and then click **Select Folder**.
3. Open the integrated terminal from Visual Studio Code by selecting **View** > **Terminal** from the main menu.
4. In the terminal window, copy and paste the following command:

```.NET CLI
dotnet new webapi -f net6.0
```

This command creates the files for a basic web API project that uses controllers, along with a C# project file named ContosoPizza.csproj that will return a list of weather forecasts.

```
**Important**
Web API projects are secured with `https` by default. If you have problems, **configure the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate**.
```

You might receive a prompt from Visual Studio Code to add assets to debug the project. Select **Yes** in the dialog.

The command uses an ASP.NET Core project template, aliased as webapi, to scaffold a C#-based web API project. A ContosoPizza directory is created. This directory contains an ASP.NET Core project running on .NET. The project name matches the ContosoPizza directory name.

You should now have access to these files and directories:

```bash
-| Controllers
-| obj
-| Properties
-| appsettings.Development.json
-| appsettings.json
-| ContosoPizza.csproj
-| Program.cs
-| WeatherForecast.cs
```

5. Examine the following files and directories:

| **Name**		| **Description**			|
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Controllers/		| Contains classes with public methods  |
|			| exposed as HTTP endpoints		|
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Program.cs		| Configures services and the app's HTTP|
|			| request pipeline, and contains the 	|
|			| app's managed entry point		|
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| ContosoPizza.csproj	| Contains configuration metadata for 	|
|			| the project				|
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|

## Build and test the web API
1. Run the following .NET Core CLI command in the command shell:

```.NET CLI
dotnet run
```

The preceding command:

* Locates the project file at the current directory.
* Retrieves and installs any required project dependencies for this project.
* Compiles the project code.
* Hosts the web API with the ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server at both an HTTP and HTTPS endpoint.

A port from 5000 to 5300 will be selected for HTTP, and from 7000 to 7300 for HTTPS, when the project is created. You can easily change the ports that you use during development by editing the project's *launchSettings.json* file. This module uses the secure `localhost` URL that begins with `https`.

You'll get output similar to the following, which indicates your app is running:

```console
Building...
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: https://localhost:7294
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5118 
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Development
```

If you're running this app on your own machine, you could direct a browser to the HTTPS link that's displayed in the output (in the preceding case, `https://localhost:7294`) to view the resulting page. Remember this port, because you'll use it throughout the module where `{PORT}` is used.

```
**Important**
Check the terminal output if you encounter any unexpected behavior. If the build fails or other errors occur, the log file's information helps you troubleshoot. As you make changes to the code, you'll need to stop the web API by selecting CTRL+C on the keyboard and rerunning the `dotnet run` command.
```

2. Open a web browser and go to:

```bash
https://localhost:{PORT}/weatherforecast
```

You should see JSON output similar to the following:

```json
[
    {
    "date": "2021-11-09T20:36:01.4678814+00:00",
    "temperatureC": 33,
    "temperatureF": 91,
    "summary": "Scorching"
    },
    {
    "date": "2021-11-09T20:36:01.4682337+00:00",
    "temperatureC": -8,
    "temperatureF": 18,
    "summary": "Cool"
    },
    // ...
]
```

3. Open a new integrated terminal from Visual Studio Code by selecting Terminal > New Terminal from the main menu, then run the following command:

```.NET CLI
dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.dotnet-httprepl
```
The preceding command installs the .NET HTTP REPL command-line tool that you'll use to make HTTP requests to the web API.

4. Connect to the web API by running the following command:

```.NET CLI
httprepl https://localhost:{PORT}
```

Alternatively, run the following command at any time while `HttpRepl` is running:

```.NET CLI
connect https://localhost:{PORT}
```

```
**Tip**
If the `HttpRepl` tool warns Unable to find an OpenAPI description, the most likely cause is an untrusted development certificate. `HttpRepl` requires a trusted connection. Before you can continue, you must configure your system to trust the dev certificate with `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`
```

5. Explore available endpoints by running the following command:

```.NET CLI
ls
```

The preceding command detects all APIs available on the connected endpoint. It should display the following:

```Output
https://localhost:{PORT}/> ls
.                 []
WeatherForecast   [GET]
```

6. Go to the WeatherForecast endpoint by running the following command:

```.NET CLI
cd WeatherForecast
```

The preceding command shows an output of available APIs for the WeatherForecast endpoint:

```
https://localhost:{PORT}/> cd WeatherForecast
/WeatherForecast    [GET]
```

7. Make a `GET` request in `HttpRepl` by using the following command:

```.NET CLI
get
```

The preceding command makes a `GET` request similar to going to the endpoint in the browser:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Fri, 02 Apr 2021 17:31:43 GMT
Server: Kestrel
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
[
    {
    "date": 4/3/2021 10:31:44 AM,
    "temperatureC": 13,
    "temperatureF": 55,
    "summary": "Sweltering"
    },
    {
    "date": 4/4/2021 10:31:44 AM,
    "temperatureC": -13,
    "temperatureF": 9,
    "summary": "Warm"
    },
    // ..
]
```

8. End the current `HttpRepl` session by using the following command:

```.NET CLI
exit
```

9. Return to the `dotnet` terminal in the drop-down list in Visual Studio Code. Shut down the web API by selecting CTRL+C on your keyboard.

**Now that you've created the web API, you'll modify it to meet the needs of the pizza web API.**
