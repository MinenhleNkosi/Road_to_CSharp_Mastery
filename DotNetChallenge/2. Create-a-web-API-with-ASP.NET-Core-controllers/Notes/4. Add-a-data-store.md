# Add a data store
Before you start to implement a web API for pizza, you need to have a **data store** on which you can perform operations.

You need a `model` class to represent a pizza in inventory. The model contains properties that represent the characteristics of a pizza. The model is used to pass data in the **web API** and to persist pizza options in the data store.

In this unit, that data store is a simple local in-memory caching service. In a real-world application, you'd consider using a database, such as SQL Server, with Entity Framework Core.

------
## Create a pizza model
1. Run the following command to create a *Models folder*:

```Bash
mkdir Models
```
Select the *Models* folder in Visual Studio Code and add a new file called *Pizza.cs*.

The project root now contains a *Models* directory with an empty *Pizza.cs* file. The directory name *Models* is a convention. The directory name comes from the *model-view-controller* architecture that the *web API* uses.

2. Add the following code to *Models/Pizza.cs* to define a pizza. Save your changes.

```cs
namespace ContosoPizza.Models;

public class Pizza
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string? Name { get; set; }
    public bool IsGlutenFree { get; set; }
}
```
------
## Add a data service
1. Run the following command to create a *Services* folder:

```Bash
mkdir Services
```

Select the folder in Visual Studio Code and add a new file called *PizzaService.cs*.

2. Add the following code to *Services/PizzaService.cs* to create an in-memory pizza data service. Save your changes.

```cs
using ContosoPizza.Models;

namespace ContosoPizza.Services;

public static class PizzaService
{
    static List<Pizza> Pizzas { get; }
    static int nextId = 3;
    static PizzaService()
    {
        Pizzas = new List<Pizza>
        {
            new Pizza { Id = 1, Name = "Classic Italian", IsGlutenFree = false },
            new Pizza { Id = 2, Name = "Veggie", IsGlutenFree = true }
        };
    }

    public static List<Pizza> GetAll() => Pizzas;

    public static Pizza? Get(int id) => Pizzas.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Id == id);

    public static void Add(Pizza pizza)
    {
        pizza.Id = nextId++;
        Pizzas.Add(pizza);
    }

    public static void Delete(int id)
    {
        var pizza = Get(id);
        if(pizza is null)
            return;

        Pizzas.Remove(pizza);
    }

    public static void Update(Pizza pizza)
    {
        var index = Pizzas.FindIndex(p => p.Id == pizza.Id);
        if(index == -1)
            return;

        Pizzas[index] = pizza;
    }
}
```
This service provides a simple in-memory data caching service with two pizzas by default. Our web API will use that service for demo purposes. When you stop and start the web API, the in-memory data cache will be reset to the two default pizzas from the constructor of `PizzaService`.

-----
## Build the web API project
Run the following command to build the app:

```.NET CLI
dotnet build
```
The build succeeds with no warnings. If the build fails, check the output for troubleshooting information.

In the next unit, you'll create a controller that will use the `Pizza` model and `PizzaService` class.
