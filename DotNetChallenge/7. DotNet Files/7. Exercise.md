# Exercise - Read and write to files.
You can also use the `File` class in .NET to write data to files and read data from files.

You're almost finished creating a .NET masterpiece for Tailwind Traders. So far, your code reads any directory, finds all .json files, and creates a *totals.txt* file.

In this exercise, you'll complete the project by reading the .json files, adding up the store totals, and writing the grand total to the *totals.txt* file.


## Add Json.NET to the project.
1. Using the terminal, add Json.NET to the project.

```bash
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
```

## Preparation for sales data.
1. At the top of `Program.cs`, add `using Newtonsoft.Json`:

```cs
using Newtonsoft.Json;
```

2. In `Program.cs` directly under the `FindFiles` method, [add a new record](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record/) that will model the sales.json data:

```cs
record SalesData (double Total);
```

## Create a method to calculate sales totals.
1. In `Program.cs`, just before the `record` line that you added in the previous step, create a new function that will calculate the sales total. This method should take an `IEnumerable<string>` of file paths that it can iterate over.

```cs
double CalculateSalesTotal(IEnumerable<string> salesFiles)
{
    double salesTotal = 0;

    // READ FILES LOOP

    return salesTotal;
}
```

2. Within that method, replace `// READ FILES LOOP` with a loop that iterates over the `salesFiles`, reads the file, parses the content as JSON, and then increments the `salesTotal` variable with the `total` value from the file:

```cs
double CalculateSalesTotal(IEnumerable<string> salesFiles)
{
    double salesTotal = 0;

    // Loop over each file path in salesFiles
    foreach (var file in salesFiles)
    {      
        // Read the contents of the file
        string salesJson = File.ReadAllText(file);

        // Parse the contents as JSON
        SalesData? data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<SalesData?>(salesJson);

        // Add the amount found in the Total field to the salesTotal variable
        salesTotal += data?.Total ?? 0;
    }

    return salesTotal;
}
```

## Call the CalculateSalesTotals method.
1. In the `Program.cs` file, add a call to the `CalculateSalesTotal` function just above the `File.WriteAllText` call:

```cs
var currentDirectory = Directory.GetCurrentDirectory();
var storesDir = Path.Combine(currentDirectory, "stores");

var salesTotalDir = Path.Combine(currentDirectory, "salesTotalDir");
Directory.CreateDirectory(salesTotalDir);

var salesFiles = FindFiles(storesDir);

var salesTotal = CalculateSalesTotal(salesFiles); // Add this line of code

File.WriteAllText(Path.Combine(salesTotalDir, "totals.txt"), String.Empty);
```

## Write the total to the totals.txt file.
1. In the `Program.cs` file, modify the `File.WriteAllText` block to write the value of the `salesTotal` variable to the *totals.txt* file. And while you're at it, change the `File.WriteAllText` call to `File.AppendAllText` so nothing in the file gets overwritten.

```cs
var currentDirectory = Directory.GetCurrentDirectory();            
var storesDir = Path.Combine(currentDirectory, "stores");

var salesTotalDir = Path.Combine(currentDirectory, "salesTotalDir");
Directory.CreateDirectory(salesTotalDir);            

var salesFiles = FindFiles(storesDir);

var salesTotal = CalculateSalesTotal(salesFiles);

File.AppendAllText(Path.Combine(salesTotalDir, "totals.txt"), $"{salesTotal}{Environment.NewLine}");
```

2. Press `Ctrl+S` to save the Program.cs file.

## Run the program.
1. Run the program from the terminal:

```bash
dotnet run
```
There's no output from the program. If you look in the *salesTotalDir/totals.txt* file, you'll find the total of all the sales from the *sales.json* file.

2. Run the program from the terminal again.

```bash
dotnet run
```

3. Select the *salesTotalDir/totals.txt* file.

The *totals.txt* file now has a second line. Every time you run the program, the totals are added up again and a new line is written to the file.

Outstanding work! You've written a smart, robust, and handy tool that Tailwind Traders can use to process all of its stores' sales every night. In the next unit, we'll review what you learned and a few tips to remember.
