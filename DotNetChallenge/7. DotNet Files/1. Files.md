# Work with the file system.
.NET contains built-in types for working with the file system that you can find in the `System.IO` namespace.
Here, you'll learn about the types available in `System.IO` by using C# to read a file system to discover files and directories.

## The scenario.
Large retailers often write data to files so it can be processed later in batches.
Tailwind Traders has each of its stores write its sales total to a file and send that file to a central location. To use those files, the company needs to create a batch process that can work with the file system.

## Include the System.IO namespace.
The `System.IO` namespace contains built-in types that allow you to interact with files and directories. For example, you can `get` and `set` properties for **files** and **directories** and retrieve collections of files and directories based on search criteria. You can also use `System.IO` namespace types to **synchronously** and **asynchronously** read and write data streams and files.

For now, we're going to focus on what you need to know to work with directories by using the `Directory` class contained in the `System.IO` namespace. The Directory class exposes static methods for creating, moving, and enumerating through directories and subdirectories.

## List all directories.
One task that you'll often do with the `Directory` class is list out (or *enumerate*) directories. For instance, Tailwind Traders has a root folder called **stores**. In that folder are subfolders organized by store number, and inside those folders are the sales-total and inventory files. The structure looks like this example:

```
ðŸ“‚ stores
    ðŸ“„ sales.json
    ðŸ“„ totals.txt
    ðŸ“‚ 201
       ðŸ“„ sales.json
       ðŸ“„ salestotals.json
       ðŸ“„ inventory.txt
    ðŸ“‚ 202
```

To read through and list the names of the top-level directories, use the `Directory.EnumerateDirectories` function.

```cs
IEnumerable<string> listOfDirectories = Directory.EnumerateDirectories("stores");

foreach (var dir in listOfDirectories) {
    Console.WriteLine(dir);
}

// Outputs:
// stores/201
// stores/202
```

## List files in a specific directory.
To list the names of all of the files in a directory, you can use the `Directory.EnumerateFiles` function.

```cs
IEnumerable<string> files = Directory.EnumerateFiles("stores");

foreach (var file in files)
{
    Console.WriteLine(file);
}

// Outputs:
// stores/totals.txt
// stores/sales.json
```

## List all content in a directory and all subdirectories.
Both the `Directory.EnumerateDirectories` and `Directory.EnumerateFiles` functions have an overload that accepts a parameter to specify that search pattern files and directories must match.
They also have another overload that accepts a parameter to indicate whether to recursively traverse a specified folder and all of its subfolders.

```cs
// Find all *.txt files in the stores folder and its subfolders
IEnumerable<string> allFilesInAllFolders = Directory.EnumerateFiles("stores", "*.txt", SearchOption.AllDirectories);

foreach (var file in allFilesInAllFolders)
{
    Console.WriteLine(file);
}

// Outputs:
// stores/totals.txt
// stores/201/inventory.txt
```
In the next exercise, you'll use the `Directory` class to dynamically read through Tailwind Traders' main *stores* directory to find all of the sales.json files.
