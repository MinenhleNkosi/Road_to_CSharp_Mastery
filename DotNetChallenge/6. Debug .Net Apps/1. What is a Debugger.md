During your journey as a developer, there's always that moment when you end up asking yourself:
    Why isn't my code working?

Asking this question is a normal part of any developer's day. The trick is to get comfortable with finding and fixing your bugs with a minimum of time and frustration. When there's a bug in your program, everyone usually has their own way of dealing with this problem. You probably already have tried one or more of these debugging approaches yourself:
* Try running your program again because it should work.
* Explain your issue to a rubber duck.
* Read through your code again to find out the issue.
* Take a walk outside.
* Spam a few Console.WriteLine("here") messages in your code.

You might have various degrees of success with these methods. The one approach that's commonly regarded as being more often successful is using a debugger. But what's a debugger exactly?

A debugger is a software tool used to observe and control the execution flow of your program with an analytical approach. Its design goal is to help find the root cause of a bug and help you resolve it. It works by either hosting your program in its own execution process or running as a separate process that's attached to your running program, like .NET.

Debuggers come in different flavors. Some work directly from the command line while others come with a graphical user interface. In this module, we'll use the integrated graphical debugger of Visual Studio Code.

## Why use a debugger.
If you're not running your code through a debugger, that means you're probably *guessing* what's happening in your program. The primary benefit of using a debugger is that you can *watch* your program running. You can follow your program execution one line of code at a time. In this way, you avoid the chance of guessing wrong.

Every debugger has its own set of features. The two most important ones that come with almost all of them are:
* Control of your program execution. You can pause your program and run it step by step, which allows you to see which code is executed and how it affects your program's state.
* Observation of your program's state. For example, you can look at the value of your variables and function parameters at any point during your code execution.

Mastering debugger usage is an important skill for a developer that's often overlooked. It makes you more efficient at hunting bugs in your code and can help you quickly understand how a program works.
