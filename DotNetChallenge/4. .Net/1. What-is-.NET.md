# What is .NET?
When someone uses the term .NET, what they mean greatly depends on context. In this unit, you'll learn about .NET by looking at it as an ecosystem. In other words, you'll learn that .NET is a collection of many parts and people that together create a powerful environment for building applications.

## .NET is an ecosystem for application development.
The term ecosystem describes the multiple facets of an application development environment and the community that surrounds it. These facets combine to create a compelling reason to invest in learning .NET and building .NET applications.

## Use .NET languages and compilers to run applications in the .NET runtime.
Software developers use **.NET languages** like **C#** and **F#** to write source code. Each line of code they write expresses an instruction or command the computer should perform while the program is running.

Before software developers can run their code, they must first compile it. The **.NET compiler** is a program that converts the source code into a special language called **intermediate language (IL)**. The .NET compiler saves the *IL* code into a file called a **.NET assembly**. By compiling the code into an **"intermediate"** format, you can use the same code base regardless of where you run the code, whether on Windows or Linux, or on 32-bit or 64-bit computer hardware.

The **.NET runtime** is an execution environment for your compiled .NET assembly. In other words, the .NET runtime is what executes and manages your application as it runs on a host operating system. We'll talk more about what the .NET runtime does in just a moment.

Fortunately, as a software developer just getting started with .NET, you don't have to understand how these mechanisms work at first. With experience, you'll come to more fully understand and appreciate the underlying power of .NET languages and compilers and the runtime.

    Tip
    Sometimes people mistakenly think that the C# programming language is .NET. However, C# and .NET are distinct. C# is a programming language syntax. As part of the syntax, you can reference and call methods defined in .NET code libraries, or assemblies. Furthermore, you'll use the C# compiler that's installed with the .NET SDK to create an assembly from your C# code. The .NET runtime runs .NET assemblies. By understanding these distinctions, you'll be aware of important concepts as you learn more about .NET and C#.

## Use .NET application frameworks and libraries to harness prebuilt functionality.
All software is built in layers, meaning software runs at various levels of abstraction on a computer:
* At the lowest level, software communicates directly with your computer's hardware. It controls the flow of data on the motherboard, processors, memory, and hard drives.
* At the next level, software allows the end user to provide instructions through an operating system.
* At the next level, software like .NET provides a way for you to develop and run applications.
* At the next level, application frameworks and libraries of functionality allow you to quickly build rich applications by using less effort than older development methods allowed.

A code library encapsulates functionality for a specific purpose into a single assembly. For .NET, thousands of libraries are available. These libraries can be first-party or third-party, and can be commercial or open source. The libraries provide a vast array of functionality you can use in your applications. You merely reference those assemblies and call the methods you need. In this way, as a developer, you build on the work of other software developers. You save time and energy because you don't have to build and maintain every feature yourself.

An application framework combines several related libraries, along with starter projects, file templates, code generators, and other tools. You can use these resources to build entire applications for a specific purpose. These application frameworks are known as app models. For example, popular .NET application frameworks are available for app models like web development, desktop and mobile development, and game development.

You can install the .NET SDK directly or by installing Visual Studio 2022. The .NET SDK preinstalls a comprehensive set of libraries and application frameworks called the base class library. You can use this library of code in your programs regardless of the platform or app models you want to build.

For other third-party libraries, developers use package managers like NuGet to find and integrate code libraries from package repositories like the NuGet Gallery.

## What are the major app models?
You might wonder which frameworks support which app models. Use the following table to map an app model to a .NET framework.

Furthermore, .NET powers popular third-party and open-source gaming development environments and engines like Unity.

## Use .NET tools to build .NET apps.
Software developers rely on tools to write code, add references to code libraries, compile code, and debug code. This section describes several **.NET** tools you'll use to build **.NET** applications.

*Visual Studio 2022* is the Microsoft flagship development environment. Millions of developers use it to build **.NET applications**. A graphical user interface (that includes menus, windows, visual designers, dialog boxes, and wizards) guides developers through the application development process. Visual Studio 2022 is available in three editions: **Community**, **Professional**, and **Enterprise**. Each edition includes different tools and is licensed for different purposes.

Developers who prefer a command-line workflow might use a combination of *Visual Studio Code*, the world's most popular code editor, and the **.NET command-line interface**, also known as the **.NET CLI**.

Furthermore, you can choose from numerous first-party and third-party tools for many advanced **.NET** use cases. Options include code profilers, unit test runners, and code coverage analyzers.

You can find other **.NET** tools for other scenarios. For example, later in this module you'll work with Try **.NET**. You'll use this browser-based interface to write simple applications that will help you learn the **C#** programming language.

## Interact with the .NET community to learn and share solutions.
The .NET ecosystem extends beyond languages, libraries, and tools to the people. You're free to both learn from the community and contribute to the community.
* **Learn**: .NET community members host live online events and in-person meet-ups. They build open-source software, participate in Q&A forums, and record video tutorials. They write books and blog posts that help you learn and get unstuck when you're not sure what to do next.
* **Contribute**: .NET is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet). The projects in this repository are managed by the .NET Foundation. This independent organization is dedicated to growing a trusted, commercially friendly, open-source ecosystem around the .NET development platform. In this repository, you can share your unique perspective and voice to help others learn.

## How does the .NET ecosystem compare to others?
If you're familiar with the software-development world, you might wonder how the .NET ecosystem compares to others. Frankly, other ecosystems can make similar claims to some or many of the statements made so far in this unit.

However, one of the most distinctive features of .NET is that its ongoing development and support comes from not only a major technology leader, but also the community. Significant portions of .NET were developed through open-source means. Community input and contributions are both welcomed and encouraged. In fact, 87 percent of contributors are outside of Microsoft. Based on community input, Microsoft actively moves the platform forward with feature enhancements, bug fixes, and performance improvements. More than 100,000 pull requests have been accepted from the community.

Additionally, the .NET ecosystem has momentum:
* .NET developers number more than 5 million!
* The results of Stack Overflow polls in 2019 and 2020 showed that .NET Core is the most loved framework.
* Students love .NET; 40 percent of developers who are new to .NET are students.
* The GitHub repositories for .NET and ASP.NET are ranked among the top 30 highest-velocity open-source software (OSS) projects.
* GitHub lists C# in the top five programming languages, and the language is increasing in popularity according to the 2020 TIOBE programming community index.
* .NET has the fastest web framework on the planet according to [TechEmpower benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r19&hw=ph&test=plaintext&a=2?azure-portal=true), an independent, open-source set of web performance benchmarks that measure dozens of languages and application frameworks.

## A brief history of .NET
The original .NET Framework was first released in early 2002. Since then, many updates and much more functionality have followed. After years of enhancements and new features, the original .NET Framework, especially key code libraries, grew significantly.

After 2002, Microsoft worked to make a version of .NET that had cross-platform compatibility. The goal was to allow developers to write one code base and use it across macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems.

Through these efforts, .NET Core was introduced around 2014. Microsoft has maintained the original .NET Framework, but new features and improvements are reserved for .NET Core. Core was later dropped from the name. The next major versions are .NET 5, .NET 6, .NET 7, and so on. Versions are generally released each November.

Why is the .NET history worth mentioning? Because you'll likely find blog posts, videos, and source code that targets the original .NET Framework. In some cases, the instructions or code still work, but in other cases, you might need to make adjustments to fit the new .NET.
