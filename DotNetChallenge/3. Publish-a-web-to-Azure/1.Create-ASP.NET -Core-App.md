# Create a new ASP.NET Core app
In this unit, you'll create, build, and run a new ASP.NET Core web application on your local machine. You'll need Visual Studio 2022 installed with the **ASP.NET and web development** and **Azure development** workloads installed.

## Create an ASP.NET Core project.
1. Open Visual Studio 2022 on your local machine.
2. From the Visual Studio landing page under **Get started**, select **Create a new project**.
3. In the search box, enter **Web**.
4. From the search results, select **ASP.NET Core Web App**.
5. Select **Next**.
6. In the new project dialog, set the **Name** field to **AlpineSkiHouse**.
7. Select a **Location** for your new solution.
8. Select **Next**.
9. Select **.NET 6.0 (Long-term support)** in the Framework drop-down.
10. Select **Create** to create your project.

    **Note**
    You can also select different starting templates in this dialog box depending on your web development requirements. At the top of the dialog box, you can also select the version of ASP.NET Core. You should select ASP.NET Core 6.0 if possible, though other recent versions of ASP.NET Core will work with this exercise as well.

11. You should now have a new ASP.NET Core web application solution.

## Build and test on your local machine.
Now, let's build and test your application on your local machine before deploying to Azure.
1. Run the app:
    Press `F5` to build the project and run in debug mode.
    Press `Ctrl+F5` to build the project and run without attaching the debugger.

2. Visual Studio starts the IIS Express web browser and loads the app.

You've now created a web application from the sample template and it's running locally. The next step is to deploy it to Azure.
