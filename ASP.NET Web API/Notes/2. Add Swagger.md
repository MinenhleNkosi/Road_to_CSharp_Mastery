# How to add Swagger in Web API.

## What is Swagger?
The **Swagger** is a simple but powerful representation of the **RESTful** API. Nowadays most developers are using **Swagger** in almost every modern programming language and deployment environment to document. With a Swagger-enabled **Web API**, you will get interactive documentation, client SDK generation as well as discoverability.

## How to Add Swagger to Web API Project?
To add Swagger to your ASP.NET Web API project, you need to install an open-source project called [Swashbuckle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Swashbuckle/) via NuGet as shown below.

Once the package is installed successfully, navigate to the **App_Start** folder in Solution Explorer. You will find a new file called **SwaggerConfig.cs**. This is the file where Swagger is enabled and any configuration options should be set here.

## How to Configure Swagger in ASP.NET Web API Application?
To enable Swagger and Swagger UI, modify the **SwaggerConfig** class as shown below.

```cs
namespace FirstWebAPIDemo
{
    public class SwaggerConfig
    {
        public static void Register()
        {
            var thisAssembly = typeof(SwaggerConfig).Assembly;
            GlobalConfiguration.Configuration
              .EnableSwagger(c => c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "First WEB API Demo"))
              .EnableSwaggerUi(); 
        }
    }
}
```
Start a new debugging session by pressing the F5 key and navigating to **http://localhost:[PORT_NUM]/swagger** and then you should see the help pages for your **APIs**.

Ok. That’s cool. Now expand an API and then click on the “**Try it out!**” button which will make a call to that specific API and return results as shown in the below image.

Here click on the Try it out Button which will display the result as shown below.

In the same way, you can test all other methods.

**How to enable Swagger to use XML Comments in ASP.NET Web API Application?**
As of now, we use the minimum configuration to get started. But now we are going to add more customization. We can tell the Swashbuckle to use our custom XML comments to add more details about our APIs to the Swagger metadata.

First, we need to enable XML documentation file creation during the build. In the Solution Explorer right-click on the Web API project and click on the Properties. Click the Build tab and navigate to Output. Make sure the XML documentation file is checked. You can leave the default file path. In our case its bin\FirstWebAPIDemo.XML as shown below

Next, we need to tell the **Swashbuckle** to include our XML comments in the Swagger metadata. To do this we need to add the following line to **SwaggerConfig.cs**. Make sure to change the file path to the path of your XML documentation file.

	c.IncludeXmlComments(string.Format(@”{0}\bin\FirstWebAPIDemo.XML”, System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory));

**Configuration, so far**
```cs
namespace FirstWebAPIDemo
{
    public class SwaggerConfig
    {
        public static void Register()
        {
            var thisAssembly = typeof(SwaggerConfig).Assembly;

            GlobalConfiguration.Configuration
              .EnableSwagger(c =>
              {
                  c.SingleApiVersion("v1", "First WEB API Demo");
                  c.IncludeXmlComments(string.Format(@"{0}\bin\FirstWebAPIDemo.XML",
                                       System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory));
              })
              .EnableSwaggerUi();
        }
    }
}
```
Let’s add some XML documents to our API methods as shown below. Here we are adding an XML Document to the get method. Modify the Get method as shown below.

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Get All the Values
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Get All the String Values
/// </remarks>
/// <returns></returns>
public IEnumerable<string> Get()
{
    return new string[] { "value1", "value2" };
}
```
Run the application and navigate back to **/swagger**. You should see more details added to your API documentation as shown below.

As of 2023, swagger is installed to visual studio by default.
