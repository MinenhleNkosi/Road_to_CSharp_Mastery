# What is ASP.NET Web API?
The term API refers to "Application Programming Interface" and ASP.NET Web API is a framework created by microsoft which makes it easier to build Web APIs, e.g) HTTP based services.
The ASP.NET Web API is an ideal platform for building Restful services on top of the .NET Framework. 
These Web API services can be consumed by a variety of clients such as:
1. Browsers
2. Mobile Applications 
3. Desktop applications
4. IOT, etc

The most important thing to keep in mind is that we can develop both Restful and Non-Restful Web Services using the ASP.NET Web API framework. But mostly this framework is used to create RESTful services. In short, this framework does not provide any specific architectural style for creating the services

## Wha are IOT's?
IOTs stands for Internet Of Things and it is actually a network of physical devices, buildings,  vehicles, and other items that are embedded with electronics, sensors, software, actuators, and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange information or you can say data.

In other words, we can say, the Internet Of Things (IoT) are the objects or devices which should have an IP address and they can communicate with other Internet-enabled devices and objects over the Internet. Examples of IoT include security systems, thermostats, electronic appliances, cars, etc, in addition to laptops, desktops, and smartphones.

## What is Rest?
REST stands for "Representational State Transfer". This is an architectural pattern used for exchanging data over the distrubuted environment.
In REST, there is something called Client and Server, and the data can be exchanged between the clinet and the server over a distrubuted environment. 
Distributed environment means that the client can be on any platform like Java, .NET, PHP, etc.
The server can also be on any platform Like: Java, .NET, PHP, etc.
The RST architectural pattern treats each **service as a resource** and client can access those resources by using the **HTTP** Protocol methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

## What are HTTP Verbs or HTTP Methods?
In Restful services, the HTTP Verbs identify what type of operation, the service is going to be performed. Let us understand what all HTTP Methods or Verbs are available.

### GET Method:
The **HTTP GET** Method is used to Retrieve the Data. The **HTTP GET** method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using **GET** should only be used to request data (they shouldn’t include data). For example, you want to search something like you want to get the list of employees, list of products, you want to retrieve a book by id, etc. So, whenever you are expecting some data from the server, you need to use **HTTP GET** Verb.
In the case of the **HTTP Get** Method, the **Web API** may be expecting some data from the client, but the main purpose of the **GET** method is to fetch or retrieve data from the server. If you want to implement some kind of search functionality then the Web API may expect some data to filter out the results. In this case, the clients need to send the data. 

### POST Method:
The **POST** request is used to make a new entry in the database. It is not only specific to a database, whenever you want to create a new resource in your application, then you need to use the **POST** method.
What does it mean by adding a new Resource? It means if you want to add a new Employee, or you want to add a new product. So, here the main concept is not the database, the main concept is adding a new resource.

### PUT method:
**PUT** is also one of the **HTTP** Verb. The **PUT** method is used to update all the properties of the current resources in the database. What does it mean? For Example, we have a table called Product in our database. If we want to update all properties of a particular product (i.e. current resource) then we need to use **HTTP PUT** Request. So, whenever you want to update all the properties (column) of a resource (existing record in the database), then you need to use **PUT** Method. You cannot add a new resource using the **PUT** method.

### PATCH Method:
There are some situations where you don’t want to update all the properties of an existing resource instead you want to update a few of the properties, then you need to use the **PATCH** method. So, the **PATCH** method is similar to the **PUT** method, but it is used to update a few properties of the current resource in the database. For example, if you want to update a few properties (columns) of an existing product then you need to use the **PATCH** method. That means if your Product table contains 10 columns, and you want to update only four columns of an existing product, then you need to use the **PATCH** method.

### DELETE Method:
The **DELETE** method is used to delete the resource from the database. That means you are removing or deleting an existing entity from your database. In modern applications, we use two concepts for delete. One is Soft Delete and another one is Hard Delete.

1. **Soft Delete:** In your table, if you have some column like **IsDeleted** or **IsActive** or something similar to this and you just want to update that column then you cannot use **Delete** Method. In that case, you need to use the **PATCH** method. This is because you are not deleting the record from the database, you just update the record.
2. **Hard Delete:** If you want to remove the existing entity from the table, then you need to use the **DELETE** method. For example, Delete an existing product from the Product table in the database, etc.

There are other **HTTP** Methods available, but these are the most used **HTTP** Methods, we generally used in our applications.

## What are the RESTful services?
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST is an architectural pattern used for exchanging data over a distributed environment. REST architectural pattern treats each service as a resource and a client can access these resources by using HTTP protocol methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. The REST architectural pattern specifies a set of constraints that a system should be adhered to. Here are the REST constraints.

1. **Client-Server Constraint:**
This is the first constraint. This constraint specifies that a Client sends a request to the server and the server sends a response back to the client. This separation of concerns supports the independent development of both client-side and server-side logic. That means client applications and server applications should be developed separately without any dependency on each other. A client should only know resource URIs and that’s all.

2. **Stateless Constraint:**
The next constraint is the Stateless Constraint. The stateless constraint specifies that the communication between the client and the server must be stateless between requests. That means the server should not be storing anything on the server related to the client. The request from the client should contain all the necessary information so that the server can identify the client and can process that request. This ensures that each request can be treated independently by the server.

3. **Cacheable Constraint:**
In real-time applications, some data provided by the server is not changed that frequently like the list of Countries, the list of States,  the list of cities, and some master data. The Cacheable Constraint says that let the client know how long this data is good for so that the client does not have to come back to the server for that data over and over again.

4. **Uniform Interface Constraint:**
The Uniform Interface Constraint defines an interface between the client and the server. To understand the uniform interface constraint, first, we need to understand what a resource is and the HTTP verbs such as GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, and DELETE. In the context of a RESTFUL Service, resources typically represent data entities. The Product, Employee, Customer, Country, State, City, etc. are all resources. The HTTP verb (GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, and DELETE) that is sent with each request tells the API what to do with the resource. Each resource is identified by a specific URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).

5. **Content Negotiation:**
One of the constraints of the REST service is that the client should have the ability to decide in which format they want the response – whether they want the response in XML or JSON etc. This is called Content Negotiation.

6. **Layered System:**
REST allows us to use a layered system architecture where we deploy the APIs in server A, and store data on server B and authenticate requests in server C. For example, a client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the server or to an intermediary along the way.

## What is the difference between REST and SOAP?
Let us discuss the difference between the **REST** and **SOAP** service:
	1. **SOAP** stands for `Simple Object Access Protocol` whereas **REST** stands for `Representational State Transfer`.
	2. The **SOAP** is an `XML-based protocol` whereas **REST** is not a protocol rather it is an architectural pattern i.e. `resource-based` architecture.                         
	3. **SOAP** has specifications for both stateless and state-full implementation whereas **REST** is completely stateless.
	4. **SOAP** enforces message format as `XML` whereas **REST** does not enforce message format as `XML` or `JSON`.
	5. The **SOAP** message consists of an envelope that includes `SOAP headers and a body` to store the actual information we want to send whereas **REST** uses the `HTTP build-in headers` (with a variety of media types) to store the information and uses the `HTTP Methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE` to perform CRUD operations.
	6. **SOAP** Performance is slow as compared to **REST**.

## What are the Differences between the WCF Service and Web API Service? When to choose one over the other?
The first important point is that we can use both WCF and ASP.NET Web API to develop restful services. In fact, WCF comes first, and then ASP.NET Web API.

WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) is one of the choices available in the .NET Framework for developing both SOAP and REST services. The problem with WCF is that a lot of configuration is required to turn a WCF service (SOAP service) into a REST service. So the more natural choice for developing REST services is ASP.NET Web API. In fact, ASP.NET Web API is specifically designed for this purpose i.e. for developing Restful Services.

### WCF
1. It is a framework used for developing SOA (service-oriented applications). 
2. WCF can only be consumed by clients, which can understand XML. WCF supports protocols like – HTTP, TCP, Named Pipes, etc.

### ASP.NET Web API 
1. It is a framework that helps us to develop HTTP Based services i.e. Restful Services.
2. Web API is an open-source platform.
3. It supports most of the MVC features which keep Web API over WCF.

### Why Do I need to choose ASP.NET WEB API?
Nowadays, a web application is not sufficient or enough to reach all its customers. People are becoming very smart; they are using different types of devices such as mobile, iPhones, tablets, etc. in their daily life. These devices are having a lot of apps that makes their life easy. In simple words, we can say that we are moving toward the apps world from the web.

So, if we want to expose our data (business data) to the browsers as well as to all these modern devices apps in a fast, secure and simple way, then we should have an API that should be compatible with browsers as well as all these modern devices.

The ASP.NET WEB API is a great framework for building HTTP services that can be consumed by a broad range of clients including browsers, mobiles, iPhones, and tablets.

## What are the differences between ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Web API?
**ASP.NET MVC**
1. ASP.NET MVC Framework basically used to create a web application by following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, in which we can build web pages.
2. In ASP.NET MVC, the action method can return both data and view. It only returns data in JSON format using JsonResult
3. All requests are mapped to the respective action method based on the action method names.
4. Content negotiation is not supported.

**ASP.NET Web API**
1. ASP.NET Web API Framework is used to develop Restful services that can be consumed by different clients.
2. ASP.NET Web API Framework returns data in JSON, XML, or any other format based on the Accept header in the request. It does not return the view to the client.
3. All requests are mapped to actions using HTTP verbs.
4. Content-negotiation supported.

**Note:** We can mix ASP.NET Web API and ASP.NET MVC controller in a single project to handle advanced AJAX requests which may return data in JSON, XML, or any other format, and build a full-blown HTTP service. Typically, this will be called ASP.NET Web API self-hosting.

## What are the advantages of using ASP.NET Web API?
Using ASP.NET Web API has a number of advantages, but the core advantages are as follows:
1. It supports all the HTTP features. That means you can use all the built-in HTTP Heapers such as Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, etc. and HTTP Status codes such as 500, 200, 404, etc., and HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE to perform CRUD operations
2. It supports Attribute Routing which is good for SEO as well as user-friendly URLs.
3. It supports content negotiation i.e. as per the client request, the server sends the response in that format (if possible). The Response is generated in JSON or XML format using [MediaTypeFormatter](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/media-type-formatters-web-api/)
4. It has the ability to be hosted in IIS as well as self-host outside of IIS.
5. Supports Model Binding and Validation.
