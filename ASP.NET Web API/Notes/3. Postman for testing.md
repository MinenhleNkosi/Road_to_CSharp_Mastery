# How to use POSTMAN to test Web API.

## What is POSTMAN?
The Postman is the most popular and most powerful HTTP client for testing restful web services. Postman makes it easy to test the Restful Web APIs, as well as develops and documents Restful APIs by allowing the users to quickly put together both simple and complex HTTP requests. The Postman is available as both a Google Chrome in-browser app and Google Chrome Packaged App.

Let’s see how to use POSTMAN to send an HTTP request to our local ASP.NET Web API Services and check the response.
**Step 1**: Download and install POSTMAN from [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en)
**Step 2**: Once the Postman is successfully installed, open the Postman. It will look like the image shown below.

### GET Request using Postman:
Select the HTTP Method as “GET” and enter the URL of your Web API as shown in the below image.

Once you click on the Send button, an HTTP request is sent to the provided URL. The response coming from the Web API Server is displayed in the below image.

As you can see in the above image, the HTTP response shows data and response status. Thus, you can also use Postman to test your Web API.

### POST Request using Postman:
1. Choose the HTTP verb as **POST**
2. Set the URL
3. Set the Content-Type as **application/json**. To do this click on the Header tab and provide the key value as shown in the below image.

Next, we need to provide the string value that we want to add to the string array. We need to provide string values in the request body. To do so click on the body tab and provide the string value as shown below.

Once you provided the string value in the request body, click on the send button which will issue a post request to the web *API*. In the same way, you can test the *PUT* and *DELETE* Requests.
