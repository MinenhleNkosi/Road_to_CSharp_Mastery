# Creating ASP.NET Web API Application

## Creating ASP.NET Web API Application using Visual Studio.
First, open the Visual Studio and then select **File => New Project** as shown in the below image.

Once you click on the OK button, It will take some time to create the project for us.

**Understanding the Folder Structure of Web API Application:**
If you have worked with ASP.NET MVC Framework, then the project folder structure should be familiar to you as shown below. 

![pic](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Web-API-Project-Structure.png)

Here, we have separate folders for Models, Views, and Controllers and moreover, within the Controllers folder, we have both MVC as well as Web API Controller as shown in the below image.

The important thing to keep in mind is that the Web API Controllers are different from MVC Controllers. In our example, the ValuesController is WebAPI Controller.

![pic](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Values-Controller.png)

If you observe the above **ValuesController** Class, then you will see that it inherits from the **ApiController** class which is present in **sytem.web.http** namespace.
Further, if you notice that the **HomeController** class is an MVC Controller, which is inherited from the **Controller** class that is present in **System.Web.Mvc** namespace is shown in the below image.

## Here we are going to focus on the Web API controller (i.e. Values Controller).
Notice that in the **ValuesController** we have methods such as Get, Put, Post, and Delete that map to the HTTP verbs GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE respectively as shown in the below image. 

![pic](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Values-Controller-methods.png)

We have 2 overloaded versions of the **Get()** method – One method without any parameters and the other one with the id parameter. Both of these methods respond to the **GET HTTP** verb depending on whether the id parameter is passed or not in the URL.

Now let’s look at the default route for our Web API project. We have the **Application_Start()** method within the **Global.asax** file. This method is executed when the application starts for the first time and it is also going to be executed only once. In the **Application_Start()** method we have the configuration for Filters, Bundles, etc. as shown below. 

![pic](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Application-Start-File.png)

Here, we are only interested in **WebApiConfig.Register()** method. So right-click on the **WebApiConfig.Register** method and then select the **Go To Definition** from the context menu which will take you to the **Register()** method of the **WebApiConfig** class as shown below.

-----
## This class is in the App_Start folder.
You can see a default route is configured within the **Register()** method for our Web API project. The Web API routes are different from the MVC routes. You can find the MVC routes in **RouteConfig.cs** file which is present in the **App_Start** folder.

The default route in Web API starts with the word **API** followed by a **/** and then the name of the **controller** and then another **/** and an optional id parameter as shown below.

`“api/{controller}/{id}”`

At this point, if you use the following URI in the browser, you will get an error stating – `Authorization has been denied for this request`.

`http://localhost:xxxxx/api/values`

To get rid of this error, comment Authorize attribute on the **ValuesController** class. This is related to security which we will discuss in a later.

Now if you issue the URI `http://localhost:xxxxx/api/values` in the browser, then you should see the following **XML** as the result

-----
## Let us understand what is going on here.
The name of the controller is **values** So if you issue a URI `http://localhost:portnumber/api/values` then the Web API Framework is going to look for a controller with the name **Values +** the word **controller** i.e. **ValuesController** in your application.

So if you have specified values in the URI it is going to look for **ValuesController** if you specify **Products** then it is going to look for **ProductsController**. 

In a real-world application, this might be the domain name, for example, `http://dotnettutorials.net/api/values` The browser is issuing a **GET** request which maps to the **Get()** method in the **ValuesController** class. The **GET()** in the values controller is returning **value1** and **value2** which is what we see in the browser.

We have another overload of **GET()** method within the **Values Controller** which takes the **Id** parameter. If you remember with the default route within the **WebApiConfig** file, we specified the id parameter as optional. This is the reason why we are able to call the **GET** method with or without the **Id** parameter. So, if you specified the id parameter in the URL, then, the **Get()** method with the id parameter in the values controller is going to be called. 

If a controller with the specified name is not found by the Web API Framework, then the Framework will have an error. For example, in our application, if we comment “ValuesController” class in our project and then use the URL `/api/values` then you will get the following error

**No HTTP resource was found that matches the request URI ‘http://localhost:15648/api/values’. No type was found that matches the controller named ‘values’.**

## Let’s discuss POST, PUT and DELETE.
In a database table row, we can perform the following 4 actions:

![pic](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/CRUD-Operations.png)

From the ASP.NET Web API point of view, these 4 actions correspond to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE verbs as shown below 

![pic](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Http-VERB-For-CRUD.png)

-----
## Let us discuss some terms and concepts which are related to HTTP requests and responses.
**Request Verbs:**
The HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE describe what should be done with the Web API resource. For example, do you need to read, create, update or delete an entity? The HTTP Verbs GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE are the most commonly used verbs in real-time applications.

**Request Header:**
When a client sends the request to the server, the request contains a header and a body. The header of the request contains some additional information such as what type of response the client required. For example, the client wants the response to be in XML or JSON format.

**Request Body:**
The Request Body contains the data that you want to send to the server. For example, a POST request contains the data in the Request Body for the new item that you want to create. The data may be in the form of XML or JSON.

**Response Body:**
The Response Body contains the data that is sent as a response from the server. For example, if you request a specific employee, then the response body includes the employee details either in the form of XML or JSON.

**Response Status codes:**
The Response Status Codes are the HTTP status codes that will specify the status of the request. The most common status codes are 200/OK, 204/No Content, 500/Internal Server Error, and 404/Not Found.

To perform the GET, POST, PUT & DELETE actions, we will use a tool called Fiddler. You can download fiddler from the following link.
[fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler)

## Modify the ValuesController as shown below, so that it can support POST, PUT and DELETE actions.
```cs
public class ValuesController : ApiController
{
    static List<string> strings = new List<string>()
    {
        "value0", "value1", "value2"
    };
    // GET api/values
    public IEnumerable<string> Get()
    {
        return strings;
    }

    // GET api/values/5
    public string Get(int id)
    {
        return strings[id];
    }

    // POST api/values
    public void Post([FromBody]string value)
    {
        strings.Add(value);
    }

    // PUT api/values/5
    public void Put(int id, [FromBody]string value)
    {
        strings[id] = value;
    }

    // DELETE api/values/5
    public void Delete(int id)
    {
        strings.RemoveAt(id);
    }
}
```
At the moment the **Post(),** **Put()** and **Delete()** methods in the **ValuesController** are returning void. That is the reason why we are getting the status code `204 No Content`. In ASP.NET Web API, an action method that returns void will send the status code `204 No Content` by default, but we can control this behavior.
