# Garbage Collection in C#.NET Framework
## What is Garbage Collection in .NET Framework?
When a dot net application runs, lots of objects are created. At a given point in time, it is possible that some of those objects are not used by the application. Garbage Collector in .NET Framework is nothing but a Small Routine or you can say it’s a Background Process Thread that runs periodically and try to identify what objects are not being used currently by the application and de-allocates the memory of those objects.

So, Garbage Collector is nothing but, it is a feature provided by CLR which helps us to clean or destroy unused managed objects. Cleaning or destroying those unused managed objects basically reclaim the memory.

**Note:** The Garbage Collector will destroy only the unused managed objects. It does not clean unmanaged objects. 

## Managed and Unmanaged objects in .NET Framework:
Let us understand Managed and Unmanaged objects. Whenever we create any EXE (i.e. console application, windows application, etc.) or web application (i.e. ASP.NET MVC, Web API, ASP.NET, Class Library, etc.) in .NET Framework using visual studio and using any .NET supported programming language such as C#, VB, F#, etc., then these applications are run completely under the control of CLR (Common Language Runtime). That means, if your applications have unused objects, then CLR will clean those objects using Garbage Collector.

Now, let’s say, you have also used other third-party EXE in your .NET application like Skype, PowerPoint, Microsoft Excel, etc. These “EXEs” are not made in dot net, they are made using some other programming languages such as C, C++, Java, etc.

When you use these “EXEs” in your application, then these are not run by CLR. Even though you are running these “EXE” in dot net applications, they are going to run under their own environment. For example, if one EXE is developed using C or C++, then that EXE will run under the C or C++ runtime environment. In the same line, if the EXE is created using VB6, then it is going to run under the VB6 runtime environment.

## What Exactly is the Managed and Unmanaged Code in .NET?
The codes which run under the complete control of CLR are called Managed Code in .NET Framework. These kinds of code (Managed code in C#) are run by a dot net runtime environment. If the dot net framework is not installed or if dot net runtime is not available, then these kinds of codes are not going to be executed. CLR will provide all the facilities and features of .NET to the managed code execution like Language Interoperability, Automatic Memory Management, Exception Handling Mechanism, Code Access Security, etc.

On the other hand, Skype, PowerPoint, and Microsoft Excel do not require dot net runtime, they run under their own environment. So, in short, the code (EXE, Web App) which not run under the control of CLR is called unmanaged code in .NET. CLR will not provide any facilities and features of .NET to the unmanaged code in C# execution like Language Interoperability, Automatic memory management, Exception handling mechanism, code access security, etc.

## Garbage Collection Generations in C#.NET:
Let us understand what Garbage Collector Generations are and how does it affect Garbage Collection performance. There are three generations. They are Generation 0, Generation 1, and Generation 2.

## Understanding Generation 0, 1, and 2:
Let’s say you have a simple application called App1. As soon as the application starts it creates 5 managed objects. Whenever any new objects (fresh objects) are created, they are moved into a bucket called Generation 0. For better understanding please have a look at the following image.

We know our hero Mr. Garbage Collector runs continuously as a background process thread to check whether there are any unused managed objects so that it reclaims the memory by cleaning those objects. Now, let’s say two objects (Object1 and Object2) are not needed by the application. So, Garbage Collector will destroy these two objects (Object1 and Object2) and reclaims the memory from Generation 0 bucket. But the remaining three objects (Object3, Object4, and Object5) are still needed by the application. So, the Garbage collector will not clean those three objects. What Garbage Collector will do is, he will move those three managed objects (Object3, Object4, and Object5) to Generation 1 bucket as shown in the below image.

Now, let’s say your application creates two more fresh objects (Object6 and Object7). As fresh objects, they should be created in Generation 0 bucket as shown in the below image.

Now, again Garbage Collector runs and it comes to Generation 0 bucket and checks which objects are used. Let’s say both objects (Object6 and Object7) are unused by the application, so it will remove both objects and reclaims the memory. Now, it goes to the Generation 1 bucket, and checks which objects are unused. Let’s say Object4 and Object5 are still needed by the application while object3 is not needed. So, what Garbage Collector will do is, it will destroy Object3 and reclaims the memory as well as will move Object4 and Object5 to Generation 2 bucket which is shown in the below image.
