# Access Specifiers in C# with Examples
## What are Access Specifiers in C#?
Every keyword that we use such as private, public, protected, virtual, sealed, partial, abstract, static, base, etc. is called Modifiers. Access Specifiers are special kinds of modifiers using which we can define the scope of a type and its members.

So, in simple words, we can say that the Access Specifiers are used to define the scope of the type (**Class, Interface, Structs, Delegate, Enum, etc**.) as well as the scope of their members (**Variables, Properties, Constructors, and Methods**). Scope means accessibility or visibility that is who can access them and who cannot access them are defined by the Access Specifiers. Say, I have a class with a set of members, who can consume these members, and who cannot consume these members is defined by the access specifiers.

## Different Types of Access Specifiers in C#:
C# supports 6 types of access specifiers. They are as follows:
1. Private
2. Public
3. Protected
4. Internal
5. Protected Internal
6. Private Protected (C# Version 7.2 onwards)

Members that are defined in a type with any scope or specifiers are always accessible within that type; restriction comes into the picture only when we try to access them outside of the type. Each and every access specifier has a different scope and let us understand the scope of each access specifier with examples.

**Note:** Using Visual Studio 2019. The previous version of Visual Studio might not be supporting the newly provided access specifier private protected.

## Understand Type and Type Members in C#:
Before understanding Access Specifier, let us first understand what are Types and Type Members in C#. Please have a look at the below diagram. Here, Example (which is created by using the class keyword) is a Type, and Variable ID, Property Name, Constructor Example, and Method Display are type members.

So, in general classes, structs, enums, interfaces, and delegates are called types, and variables, properties, constructors, methods, etc. that normally reside within a type are called type members. The type members can have all 6 access specifiers whereas types can have only 2 (internal, public) Access Modifiers. By default, if we have not specified any type, then for type is going to be internal access specifier and for type members, it is going to be a private Access Specifier. With this keep mind, let us proceed and understand all 6 Access Specifiers in C# with Examples.

## Example to Understand Access Specifiers in C# with Examples:
Letâ€™s discuss each Access Specifier in C# with Examples. For this create a new console application with the name **AccessSpecifierDemo**. Once you created this Console Application one assembly is created with the extension EXE. To understand Access Specifiers in C#, we at least need two assemblies. So, let us add a class library project to our solution which will create another assembly with a DLL extension. We need to follow the below steps to add the class library project.

Right-click on the Solution Explorer and then select **Add -> New Project** option from the context menu as shown in the below image.

Once you click on the New Project, it will open the following Add New Project Dialog Box. Here, first, search for the class library in the search window and then select Class Library (.NET Framework) using the C# language project template and then click on the Next button as shown in the below image.

Once you click on the OK button, it will open the Configure Your New Project window. Provide the Project name as AssemblyOne and select 4.8 as the Dot Net Framework and then click on the Create button as shown in the below image.

Once you click on the Create button, it will add the Class Library Project with the name **AssemblyOne** to our solution. If you have followed the steps correctly, now you should have two projects in the solution explorer as shown in the below image.

Now build the solution, and you will see that 2 assemblies are generated. One DLL (for the Class Library Project with the name **AssemblyOne.DLL**) and one EXE (for the Console Application with the name **AccessSpecifierDemo.EXE**). To locate the assembly location i.e. where the assembly is generated, please follow the below steps.
1. Right-click on the AssemblyOne project (or your console application project), in solution explorer and select Open Folder in Windows Explorer.
2. Open bin folder
3. Then open the Debug folder
4. In the Debug folder, you should see AssemblyOne.dll or AccessSpecifierDemo.exe, which is the physical assembly.

## What are Assemblies in .NET Framework?
According to MSDN, Assemblies are the building block of .NET Framework applications; they form the fundamental unit of deployment. In simple words, we can say that Assembly is nothing but a precompiled .NET Code that can be run by CLR (Common Language Runtime).

For a console application, the assembly is EXE and for the class library project, the assembly is DLL. We cannot run a DLL directly but we can run an EXE directly.
