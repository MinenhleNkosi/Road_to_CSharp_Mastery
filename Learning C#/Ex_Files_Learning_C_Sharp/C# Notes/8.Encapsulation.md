# Encapsulation
**Encapsulation Hides the internal state and functionality of an object and only allows access through a public set of functions**.

The process of binding or grouping the **State** (**Data Members**) and **Behaviour** (**Member Functions**) together into a single unit (i.e. **class, interface, struct, etc**) is called encapsulation in C#. The Encapsulation Principle ensures that the state and behavior of a unit cannot be accessed directly from other units.

The Encapsulation Principle in C# is very similar to a Capsule. As a capsule binds its medicine within it, in the same way, in C#, the Encapsulation Principle binds the State (Variables) and Behaviour (Methods) into a single unit called class, enum, interface, etc. So, you can think of Encapsulation as a cover or layer that binds related states and behavior together in a single unit.

## Example to Understand Encapsulation in C#:
Every class, interface, struct, enum, etc. that we created is an example of encapsulation, so let’s create a class called Bank as follows to understand the encapsulation:

```cs
namespace EncapsulationDemo
{
    class Bank
    {
        public long AccountNumber;
        public string Name;
        public int Balance;

        public void GetBalance()
        {
        }
        public void WithdrawAmount()
        {
        }
        public void Deposit()
        {
        }
    }
}
```

Here the class Bank is an example of Encapsulation. The variables(AccountNumber, Name, and Balance) and methods(GetBalance, WithdrawAmount, and Deposit) of the class are bound in a single unit which is the Bank class. Here, the encapsulation binds the implementation details of the Bank class with it and hides it from other classes. If other classes want to access these detail, they need to create the object of the Bank class in order to access its data and behavior as shown in the below code.

```cs
namespace EncapsulationDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Bank bank = new Bank();
            bank.AccountNumber = 12345678;
            bank.Name = "Pranata";
            bank.GetBalance();
            bank.WithdrawAmount();
        }
    }
}
```

Similarly, if you create an interface, struct, or enum, that is also an example of encapsulation. The biggest advantage of Encapsulation is Data Hiding. That means using Encapsulation, we can achieve Data Hiding.

## What is Data Hiding in C#?
Data hiding or Information Hiding is a Process in which we hide internal data from outside the world. The purpose of data hiding is to protect the data from misuse by the outside world. Data hiding is also known as data encapsulation. Without the Encapsulation Principle, we cannot achieve data hiding.

In simple words, we can also say that the process of defining a class by hiding its internal data members from outside the class and accessing those internal data members only through publicly exposed methods (setter and getter methods) or properties with proper validations is called encapsulation.

**Note:** Data encapsulation is also called data hiding because by using this principle we can hide the internal data from outside the class.

## How can we Implement Data Hiding or Data Encapsulation in C#?
In C#, Data Encapsulation is implemented:
1. By declaring the variables as private (to restrict their direct access from outside the class)
2. By defining one pair of public setter and getter methods or properties to access private variables from outside the class.

We declare variables as private to stop accessing them directly from outside the class. The public setter and getter methods or public properties are used to access the private variables from outside the class with proper validations. If we provide direct access to the variables of a class then we cannot validate the data before storing it in the variable or while retrieving the data stored in the variable. So the point that you need to remember is by implementing Data Encapsulation or Data Hiding in C#, we are protecting or securing the data.

So, Data Encapsulation or Data Hiding in C# is implemented by using the Access Specifiers. C# in our previous article. C# supports the following six access specifiers:
1. **public:** The public members can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.
2. **private:** The private members can be accessed only by code in the same class.
3. **protected:** The protected Members in C# are available within the same class as well as to the classes that are derived from that class.
4. **internal:** The internal members can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.
5. **protected internal:** The protected internal members can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it’s declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly.
6. **private protected:** The private protected members can be accessed by types derived from the class that is declared within its containing assembly.


## Implementing Data Encapsulation or Data Hiding in C# using Setter and Getter Methods: 
Let us see an example to understand Encapsulation in C#. In the following example, we declare the balance variable as private in the Bank class, and hence it can not be accessed directly from outside of the Bank class. In order to access the balance variable from outside the Bank class, we have exposed two public methods i.e. GetBalance and SetBalance. The GetBalance method (which is also called getter) is used to fetch the value stored in the balance variable whereas the SetBalance method (which is also called Setter) is used to set the value in the balance variable from outside the bank class. Within the Bank class, you can access the private variables directly, but you cannot access them directly from outside of the Bank class.

```cs
using System;
namespace EncapsulationDemo
{
    public class Bank
    {
        //Hiding class data by declaring the variable as private
        private double balance;

        //Creating public Setter and Getter methods

        //Public Getter Method
        //This method is used to return the data stored in the balance variable
        public double GetBalance()
        {
            //add validation logic if needed
            return balance;
        }

        //Public Setter Method
        //This method is used to stored the data  in the balance variable
        public void SetBalance(double balance)
        {
            // add validation logic to check whether data is correct or not
            this.balance = balance;
        }
    }
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Bank bank = new Bank();
            //You cannot access the Private Variable
            //bank.balance; //Compile Time Error

            //You can access the private variable via public setter and getter methods
            bank.SetBalance(500);
            Console.WriteLine(bank.GetBalance());   //Outup: 500
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

## What are the Advantages of Providing Variable Access via Setter and Getter Methods in C#?
If we are Providing Variable Access via Setter and Getter Methods in C#, then we can validate the user-given data before storing the value in the variable. In the above program, for example, if you don’t want to store the negative value in the balance variable, you check and validate the value before storing it in the variable. So, we can validate the given value before storing it in the balance variable. If we provide direct access to the balance variable, then it is not possible to validate the given amount value before storing it in the balance variable.

So, the main reason for using data hiding is security. As we use private access specifiers with our variables, we can store critical information in such variables which will be visible within the class only. No one else can access them directly. We can also apply some validation in setter and getter methods whenever needed. It also increases the security, so that no one can set any illegal data for any misuse.

## What is the Problem if we don’t follow Encapsulation Principle in C# while Designing a Class?
If we don’t follow the Encapsulation Principle in C# while designing the class, then we cannot validate the user-given data according to our business requirements as well as it is very difficult to handle future changes. Let us understand this with an example. Assume in the initial project requirement the client did not mention that the application should not allow the negative number to store. So, we give direct access to the variable from outside the class and now, the user can store any value to it as shown in the below example. Here, you can see that we are accessing the Amount variable directly from outside the Bank class and setting both positive as well as negative values into it.

```cs
using System;
namespace EncapsulationDemo
{
    public class Bank
    {
        public int Amount;
    }
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Bank bank = new Bank();
            //We can access the Amount Variable directly

            //Setting positive amount
            bank.Amount = 50;
            Console.WriteLine(bank.Amount);     //Outup: 50

            //Setting negative amount
            bank.Amount = -150;
            Console.WriteLine(bank.Amount);    //Outup: -150

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

That’s it. It works as expected. Later, in the future, the client wants that the application should not allow a negative value. Then we should validate the user-given values before storing them in the Amount variable. Hence, we need to develop the application by following the Encapsulation Principle as follows:

```cs
using System;
namespace EncapsulationDemo
{
    public class Bank
    {
        private int Amount;
        public int GetAmount()
        {
            return Amount;
        }
        public void SetAmount(int Amount)
        {
            if (Amount > 0)
            {
                this.Amount = Amount;
            }
            else
            {
                throw new Exception("Please Pass a Positive Value");
            }
        }
    }
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            try
            {
                Bank bank = new Bank();
                //We cannot access the Amount Variable directly
                //bank.Amount = 50; //Compile Time Error
                //Console.WriteLine(bank.Amount); //Compile Time Error

                //Setting Positive Value
                bank.SetAmount(10);
                Console.WriteLine(bank.GetAmount());  //Outup: 10

                //Setting Negative Value
                bank.SetAmount(-150);
                Console.WriteLine(bank.GetAmount());  //Output: Please Pass a Positive value
            }
            catch(Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
            }
           
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementing Data Encapsulation or Data Hiding in C# using Properties:
The Properties are a new language feature introduced in C#. Properties in C# help in protecting a field or variable of a class by reading and writing the values to it. The first approach i.e. setter and getter itself is good but Data Encapsulation in C# can be accomplished much smoother with properties.

Let us understand how to implement Data Encapsulation or Data Hiding in C# using properties with an example. In the below example, inside the Bank class, we marked the **_Amount** variable as private to restrict direct access from outside the Bank class. In order to access the **_Amount** variable, we have exposed the Amount property by declaring it as public. Now from outside the Bank class, we can access the _Amount private variable through the public exposed Amount property.

```cs
using System;
namespace EncapsulationDemo
{
    public class Bank
    {
        private double _Amount;
        public double Amount
        {
            get
            {
                return _Amount;
            }
            set
            {
                // Validate the value before storing it in the _Amount variable
                if (value < 0)
                {
                    throw new Exception("Please Pass a Positive Value");
                }
                else
                {
                    _Amount = value;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            try
            {
                Bank bank = new Bank();
                //We cannot access the _Amount Variable directly
                //bank._Amount = 50; //Compile Time Error
                //Console.WriteLine(bank._Amount); //Compile Time Error

                //Setting Positive Value using public Amount Property
                bank.Amount= 10;

                //Setting the Value using public Amount Property
                Console.WriteLine(bank.Amount); //Output: 10
                
                //Setting Negative Value
                bank.Amount = -150;
                Console.WriteLine(bank.Amount); //Ouput: Please Pass a Positive Value
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```
## Advantages of Encapsulation in C#:
1. **Protection of data:** You can validate the data before storing it in the variable.
2. **Achieving Data Hiding:** The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class.
3. **Security:** The encapsulation Principle helps to secure our code since it ensures that other units(classes, interfaces, etc) can not access the data directly.
4. **Flexibility:** The encapsulation Principle in C# makes our code more flexible, which in turn allows the programmer to change or update the code easily.
5. **Control:** The encapsulation Principle gives more control over the data stored in the variables. For example, we can control the data by validating whether the data is good enough to store in the variable.
