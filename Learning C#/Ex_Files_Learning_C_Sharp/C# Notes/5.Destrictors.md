# Destructors in C# with Examples
## What are Destructors in C#?
According to **MSDN**, Destructors which are also called Finalizers in C# are used to perform any necessary final clean-up when a class instance is being collected by the garbage collector.

The Destructor is also a special type of method present in a class, just like a constructor, having the same name as the class name but prefixed with `~` tilde. The Constructor in C# is Explicitly called when the object of the class is created. On the other hand, the Destructor in C# is Implicitly Called when the object of the class is destroyed.

The Constructor and destructor methods will exactly have the same name as the class to which they belong. So, to differentiate between these two, a tilde (~) symbol is used just before the destructor method. The syntax is shown below.

**Note:** The most important point that you need to keep in mind is that a destructor method cannot have any parameters as well as cannot be applied with any modifiers. As the destructor is not parameterized, so we cannot overload the destructor.

## When is a Destructor method Called in C#?
A destructor method gets called automatically by the garbage collector when the object of the class is destroyed. So, the point that you need to remember is that the destructor methods are automatically called by the garbage collector.

## When will the Object of a Class get Destroyed in C#?
The object of a class in C# will be destroyed by the garbage collector in any of the following cases:
1. At the end of the program execution, each and every object that is associated with the program will be destroyed by the garbage collector.
2. The Implicit calling of the garbage collector occurs sometime in the middle of the program execution provided the memory is full so the garbage collector will identify unused objects of the program and destroys them.
3. The Explicit calling of the garbage collector can also be done in the middle of program execution by the programmer with the help of the “Collect()” statement so that if there are any unused objects associated with the program will be destroyed in the middle of the program execution.

## Example to Understand Destructors in C#:
In the below example, we have created one class called DestructorDemo with one constructor and one destructor. Then inside the Main method, we have created two instances of the DestructorDemo class and then made the obj1 value null which is eligible for garbage collection.

```cs
using System;
namespace DestructorExample
{
    class DestructorDemo
    {
        public DestructorDemo()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Constructor Object Created");
        }
        ~DestructorDemo()
        {
            string type = GetType().Name;
            Console.WriteLine($"Object {type} is Destroyed");
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            DestructorDemo obj1 = new DestructorDemo();
            DestructorDemo obj2 = new DestructorDemo();

            //Making obj1 for Garbage Collection
            obj1 = null;
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```
Now, when you run the above code, you will get the following output:

You can see the statements written inside the destructor are not printed in the output. Then you might be thinking that our destructor is not executed even though we made the obj2 value null. This is not right. The point that you need to remember is that the destructor method is implicitly called by the garbage collector and we cannot predict when it calls the destructor method. And hence you cannot see those print statements in the output. Once, the object is unused i.e. it ready for garbage collection, then it is the responsibility of the garbage collector to destroy that unused object and free the memory from the heap.

If you want, then you can also make an explicit call to the garbage collector in the middle of the application execution to destroy the unused object. To do so, we need to call the **GC.Collect** method as shown in the below example.

```cs
using System;
namespace DestructorExample
{
    class DestructorDemo
    {
        public DestructorDemo()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Constructor Object Created");
        }
        ~DestructorDemo()
        {
            string type = GetType().Name;
            Console.WriteLine($"Object {type} is Destroyed");
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            DestructorDemo obj1 = new DestructorDemo();
            DestructorDemo obj2 = new DestructorDemo();

            //Making obj1 for Garbage Collection
            obj1 = null;
            GC.Collect();
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```
