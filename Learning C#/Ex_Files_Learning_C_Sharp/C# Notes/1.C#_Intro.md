# Algorithm, Pseudocode, Programs, and Flowcharts
## Pseudocode:
Is an artificial and informal language that helps programmers in developing algorithms. It is basically a way to write code in words.

## Algorithm: 
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a computational problem. It is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.

First, let's learn a few analytical or problem-solving skills to write an algorithm.

**Example:**
* Let’s consider a chef who knows how to prepare a dish then he/she can easily prepare the recipe of that dish.
* Let’s consider a chemist who is well versed with different chemical reactions then he/she can easily prepare a chemical formula applying those reactions.

Once an algorithm is prepared, we need to convert it into a Program so that the computer can execute it and perform the computational task. Any programming language can be used to write a program but it must strictly follow the syntax of that programming language.

## Program:
A program is a step-by-step machine instruction used for solving any problem or computational task.

## Algorithm and Program Example:

![pic](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/algorithm-and-program-example.png)

### Let us Understand the Algorithm.
The Algorithm is for finding the average of the list of elements. That is, we have a collection of elements and we want to find out the average. First, we assign 0 to Sum. Then for each element x in the list, we begin sum assigned sum+ x i.e. adding each value of x into the sum variable. Then after that, the average is assigned sum by the number of elements, and then, return the average. So, if you read the above algorithm, you can understand how to find the average of a list of elements. Add all of them and divide by the number of elements. That’s it. This is how we write our algorithm using pseudocode.

### Let us Understand the Program.
Now the same thing for finding the average list of elements, we have written the program using C++ language. It’s a function, it’s not a complete program, just a function inside a program. If we don’t use a semicolon to end the statement, it’s an error, and instead of assignment if we write less than or a hyphen symbol, then also it is an error. So, if you want to store the value then you must use an equal symbol and that is called an assignment.

So, it means you should follow the proper syntax of a language. Because this is not for you. You are writing the program for the compiler to understand and convert it into machine code. You will write a C++ program and that gets converted into machine code or machine language. So, you are actually talking to the compiler. You should talk in such a way that you can easily understand.

If the compiler is not understanding your program, then the compiler cannot convert your program into machine code. So, you should follow the syntax perfectly. That is the reason you have to put some little extra effort into learning programming.

## What is a Flowchart?
A flowchart is used for showing the flow of control in a program and the sequence of steps involved in a hierarchical manner. It is basically a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, workflow, or process.

So, if a program is very big then it is very difficult to figure out how the flow of the program is, Flow charts are useful for understanding the program, instead of one is reading the program and understanding it, he can see the flow chart and understand how the program is working.

It is just like if you talk about electrical wiring in a home. Then from where the wires or the cables are moving through the walls. If you have a plan then you can know where exactly they are flowing and where the important points are, everything you can know. Otherwise, if there is any problem with the wiring, then you have to dig the whole wall to find out the problem. If there is a proper plan then you can understand. So before laying the wire or pulling the wires we will make a plan. In the same way, before writing the program we make a flowchart. So based on the flow chart we will write the program. This will help us to understand the program.

### Steps in the flowchart:
Usually, when we are using a flow chart for the program, it consists of three steps:
* Input
* Process
* Output

First, it takes some input. Then it will process. Then it will give the output. So, any procedure you take will have similar steps. For example, preparing a dish. 
1. Input is the ingredients. 
2. That process is the process of making a dish  
3. The output is the dish ready. 

If you take a chemistry experiment that is done usually in laboratories will have input means chemicals and the vessels or instruments whatever you need. Then the process of what you will do with that and then it gets done successfully. So, every procedure will have these 3 things and the program is also used to look like this.

### Elements of Flowchart:
Now let us look at the elements of the flow chart. The following image shows the different elements of a flowchart.


**Terminal:** The oval symbol indicates Start, Stop and Halt in a program’s logic flow. A pause/halt is generally used in programming logic under some error conditions. The terminal is the first and last symbol in the flowchart.

**Processing:** A box represents arithmetic instructions. All arithmetic processes such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are indicated by the action/process symbol.

![pic](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/word-image-98.png)


**Decision:** Diamond-shaped symbol represents a decision point. Decision-based operations such as Yes/No, question, or True/False are indicated by diamond shape in the flowchart.

*Step 1:* Start.
*Step 2:* Declare variables Number1 and Number2.
*Step 3:* Read values Number1 and Number2.
*Step 4:* Add Number1 and Number2 and store the result in Sum. (Sum = Number1 + Number2).
*Step 5:* Display Sum.
*Step 6:* Stop.

# Introduction to .NET Framework
As a C#/.NET developer it's important to know the history behind the evolution of DOT NET Framework. Beofre DOT NET, there was COM.

## What is COM?
**COM** stands for **Component Object Model**. The COM is one of the Microsoft Frameworks. Using this Framework, we can develop **Windows Applications** (Desktop or Standalone Applications for Windows OS) as well as Web Applications. In earlier COM, **VB** is the programming language that is used to implement Windows applications and **ASP** is the technology used to implement web applications.

## What are the disadvantages of COM?
There are two major disadvantages of the COM Framework. They are as follows:

1. Incomplete Object-Oriented Programming means it will not support all the features of OOPs.
2. Platform Dependent means COM applications can run on only Windows OS.

To overcome the above problems, Microsoft introduces **.NET Framework**.

## What does .NET Represent?
**NET** stands for **Network Enabled Technology** (Internet). In .NET, dot (.) refers to **Object-Oriented**, and NET refers to the internet. So, the complete .NET means through Object-Oriented we can implement internet-based applications.

According to Microsoft, **.NET** is a **Free**, **Cross-Platform**, **Open-Source** developer platform for building many different types of applications. With .NET, we can use multiple languages (C#, VB, F#, etc.), Editors (Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio for Mac, OmniSharp, JetBrains Rider, etc), and Libraries to build for Web, Mobile, Desktop, Games, IoT, and more.

**Cross Platform**: Whether you are working in C#, F#, or Visual Basic, your code will run on any compatible operating system. You can build many types of apps with .NET. Some are Cross-Platform, and some target a specific set of operating systems and devices.

**Libraries**: To extend functionality, Microsoft and others maintain a healthy .NET package ecosystem. **NuGet** is a package manager built specifically for .NET that contains over 100,000 packages.

## What is a Framework?
A framework is a software. Or you can say a framework is a collection of many small technologies integrated together to develop applications that can be executed anywhere.

### What does the .NET Framework Provide?

The DOT NET Framework provides two things as follows:
1. BCL (Base Class Libraries)
2. CLR (Common Language Runtime)

## What is BCL?
Base Class Libraries (BCL) are designed by Microsoft. Without BCL we can’t write any code in .NET. So, BCL is also known as the basic building block of .NET Programs. These are installed into the machine when we installed the .NET framework. BCL contains pre-defined classes and these classes are used for the purpose of application development.

The physical location of BCL is **C:\Windows\assembly**

## What is CLR?
CLR stands for Common Language Runtime and it is the core component under the .NET framework which is responsible for converting the MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) code into native code.

![pic](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/dot-net-framework-code-exceution-flow.png)


### In the .NET framework, the code is compiled twice.
1. In the 1st compilation, the source code is compiled by the respective language compiler and generates the intermediate code which is known as **MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language)** or **IL (Intermediate language code)**, or **Managed Code**.
2. In the 2nd compilation, **MSIL** is converted into **Native code** (native code means code specific to the Operating system so that the code is executed by the Operating System) and this is done by **CLR**.
Always 1st compilation is slow and 2nd compilation is fast.

### What is JIT?
JIT stands for the **Just-in-Time** compiler. It is the component of **CLR** that is responsible for converting **MSIL** code into **Native Code**. Native code is code that is directly understandable by the operating system.

### Different types of .NET Framework
The .NET framework is available in three different flavors
1. **.NET Framework**: .NET Framework is the original implementation of .NET. It supports running websites, services, desktop applications, and more on Windows OS Only.
2. **.NET**: .NET is a cross-platform implementation for running websites, services, and console applications on Windows, Linux, and macOS. **.NET is open source** on GitHub and .NET was previously called **.NET Core**.
3. **Xamarin/Mono**: Xamarin/Mono is a .NET implementation for running apps on all the major mobile operating systems, including iOS and Android.

**Note: .NET Framework** is **Platform-Dependent** while **.NET** or **.NET Core** is **Platform Independent**. Here, we are not talking about Web Applications. Web Applications are independent of Operating Systems.

## What is not .NET?
1. .NET is not an Operating system.
2. .NET is not a database
3. It is not an ERP application.
4. NET is not a Testing Tool.
5. It is not a programming language.

## What is Exactly .NET?
.NET is a framework tool that supports many programming languages and many technologies. .NET support 60+ programming languages. Of 60+ programming languages, 9 are designed by Microsoft and the remaining are designed by non-Microsoft. Microsoft-designed programming languages are as follows:
1. **VB.NET**
2. **C#.NET**
3. **VC++.NET**
4. **J#.NET**
5. **F#.NET**
6. **Jscript.NET**
7. **WindowsPowerShell**
8. **Iron phyton**
9. **Iron Ruby**

Technologies supported by the .NET framework are as follows:
1. **ASP.NET (Active Server Pages.NET)** – MVC, Web API, Core MVC, Core Web API, Core Blazor, etc.
2. **ADO.NET** (Active Data Object.NET)
3. **WCF** (Windows Communication Foundation)
4. **WPF** (Windows Presentation Foundation)
5. **WWF** (Windows Workflow Foundation)
6. **AJAX** (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
7. **LINQ** (Language Integrated Query)
8. **Entity** Framework

## What are a Language and its need?
1. Language acts as the mediator between the programmer and the system.
2. It offers some rules and regulations for writing the program.
3. The language also offers some libraries which are required for writing the program.

## What are Technology and its Needs?
Technology is always designed for a particular purpose. For example, the development of web-related applications in .NET using the technology ASP.NET. But the technology does not offer any specific rules for writing the programs. That’s why technology can’t be implemented individually. VB.NET, C#.NET, and F#.NET are programming languages. Using any of these languages we can implement windows/desktop applications individually. Every language is having its own compiler

# .NET Framework Architecture and Components
## .Net Framework Architecture
The two major components of the .NET Framework are the Common Language Runtime and the .NET Framework Class Library.
1. **CLR**: The **Common Language Runtime (CLR)** is the execution engine that handles running applications. It provides services like thread management, garbage collection, type safety, exception handling, and more.
2. **BCL**: The **Base Class Library** provides a set of APIs and types for common functionality. It provides types for strings, dates, numbers, etc. The Class Library includes APIs for reading and writing files, connecting to databases, drawing, and more.

The .NET applications are written in C#, F#, or VB programming languages. The Source Code is compiled into an intermediate language code called **IL** or **MSIL** or **CIL** (Common Intermediate Language). And the Compiled code is stored in assemblies with **.DLL** or **.EXE** file extension.

When an application runs, the **CLR** takes the Assembly (IL Code or MSIL Code, or CIL) and uses the **Just-in-Time compiler (JIT)** to convert the **MSIL** or **IL** code into machine code that can execute on the specific architecture of the computer it is running on.

## Applications Developed using .NET Framework
The types of applications that can be built in the .Net framework are classified broadly into the following categories.

**WinForms** – This is used for developing Forms-based applications, which would run on an end-user machine. Notepad is an example of a client-based application. Windows Forms is a smart client technology for the .NET Framework, a set of managed libraries that simplify common application tasks such as reading and writing to the file system.

**ASP.NET** – This is used for developing web-based applications, which are made to run on any browser such as Edge, Chrome or Firefox. ASP.NET is a web framework designed and developed by Microsoft. It is used to develop websites, web applications, and web services. It provides a fantastic integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was first released in January 2002.
1. The Web application would be processed on a server, which would have Internet Information Services Installed.
2. Internet Information Services or IIS is a Microsoft component that is used to execute an ASP.NET application.
3. The result of the execution is then sent to the client machines, and the output is shown in the browser.

**ADO.NET:** This technology is used to develop applications to interact with databases such as Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server. ADO.NET is a module of the .Net Framework, which is used to establish a connection between applications and data sources. Data sources can be such as SQL Server and XML. ADO .NET consists of classes that can be used to connect, retrieve, insert, and delete data.

**WCF (Windows Communication Foundation):** It is a framework for building service-oriented applications. Using WCF, you can send data as asynchronous messages from one service endpoint to another.

**LINQ (Language Integrated Query):** It is a query language, introduced in .NET 3.5 framework. It is used to make the query for data sources with C# or Visual Basics programming languages.

**Entity Framework:** It is an ORM-based open-source framework that is used to work with a database using .NET objects. It eliminates a lot of developers’ effort to handle the database. It is Microsoft’s recommended technology to deal with the database.

**Parallel LINQ:** Parallel LINQ or PLINQ is a parallel implementation of LINQ to objects. It combines the simplicity and readability of LINQ and provides the power of parallel programming. It can improve and provide fast speed to execute the LINQ query by using all available computer capabilities.

# Introduction to C# Programming Language
## Why did C#.NET come to the market?
C#.NET Programming Language is mainly designed to overcome the disadvantages of C and C++ and to develop internet applications (web applications) by achieving platform independence.

## Why C# is so much popular nowadays?
C#.NET is so much popular nowadays because of the following reasons.

### C# is Simple and Familiar:
C# is simple because C# simplifies the programmer’s job by avoiding certain features of C and C++. C# avoids explicit memory management. Memory management in C# is automatic. It is done by CLR. So, there is no chance of memory leakage. There is a pointer concept in C# but it is restricted. C# is very familiar to programmers because it is modeled on the C and C++ languages. C# uses many features of C and C++; therefore, C# codes look like C and C++ codes. We can say C# is the simplified version of C and C++.

### C# is Portable:
Portability allows the programmer to write the same code for different machines (operating systems). C# provides portability in two ways:
1. Source Code Portability
2. IL Code Portability (DLL and EXE)

In C#, we can write the source code in Multiple OS and get the output. Even though we can IL Code Portability is also available. So, once you have the DLL and EXE, then you can use those DLLs and EXEs on different OS and you can get the output as expected. Whereas in the case of C and C++ there is only source code portability.

### C# is Architecturally Neutral:
The behavior of C# programs doesn’t change when we move from one system to another which means it will provide the same output in every machine because in C# memory layout decisions are not made at compile time, it is made at run time by CLR. It is because of CTS (Common Type System) and in our coming session we will discuss it in detail. But in the case of C and C++ programs, the behavior changes when we move the program from one system to another and the reason for this is the size of data types varies from OS to OS.

### C# is Secured:
C# is secured because the C# programs are executed in a secured environment called CLR. CLR will provide security to the C# programs.

### C# is Robust:
Robust means Strong. C# is a strong type-checking language having strict type-checking during both compilation time and execution time which allows us to develop error-free applications and programs.

### C# is Distributed:
Using C# Programming Language, we can develop distributed applications whose resources are shared by more than one client. An application or program whose resources are shared by more than one client is called a distributed application. As C# is used for developing such applications for example WCF Applications, Restful Services, etc. So, C# is a distributed programming language.

### C# is Multithreaded:
A process is divided into several small parts known as threads or lightweight processes. Sending multiple threads to the processor for processing is known as multithreading. Multi-threading means handling multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, we can listen to music while scrolling a page and at the same time we can download an application from the internet on a computer. 

If multiple threads are used to execute your application code, then it is called Multithreading. Multithreading is a mechanism to implement Concurrent Programming where multiple threads execute the code simultaneously. And using C# Programming language we can develop multithread applications. So, C# supports multithreaded programming.

### C# is Dynamic:
C# 4.0 introduced a new type called dynamic that avoids compile-time type checking. A dynamic type escapes type checking at compile-time; instead, it resolves the type at run time. So, if you don’t know the type of data that you want to store, then you can use dynamic as the data type, and at runtime based on value or data, the type will automatically resolve. So, C# is dynamic.

### C# is Compiled and Interpreted:
We know a programming language is either compiled or interpreted. But C# combines both approaches. That’s why C# is called a two-stage system.

First C# compiler CSC translates source code into an intermediate language code known as MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) or CIL (Common Intermediate Language) code. But these MSIL or CIL or IL codes are not machine instructions. So, in the second stage, these MSIL or CIL, or IL codes are interpreted by the C# interpreter (One Component of CLR called JIT- Just in Time Compiler). As a result, machine instructions will be generated which are directly executed by the machine. Hence, we are saying C# is both interpreted and compiled language.

### C# is Object-Oriented:
Except for the primitive data types, all elements in C# are objects. Object-oriented is not a programming language, it is a programming technique or concept, or principle which defines a set of rules and regulations for organizing the data and instructions. The concepts provided by oops are as follows:
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

The Programming Language which supports these four features is known as an Object-Oriented Programming Language. And C# Programming Language supports these four features, so C# is Object-Oriented.

### C# is Platform Independent:
Many Programming Languages are compatible with only one platform. Now, with the introduction of **.NET Core** or **.NET**, C# was specifically designed to be platform-independent. C# applications with .NET Core or .NET can be run on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **Mac** operating systems. So, we can say C# is Platform Independent with .NET Core or .NET.

### Automatic Memory Management:
The .NET Framework automatically manages memory allocation and de-allocation for objects. When a dot net application runs, lots of objects are created. At a given point in time, it is possible that some of those objects are not used by the application. Garbage Collector in .NET Framework is nothing but a Small Routine or you can say it is a Background Process that runs periodically and try to identify what objects are not being used currently by the application and de-allocates the memory of those objects. So, as a developer, we need not worry about how memory allocation and deallocation are done in .NET Applications.

### Exception Handling:
C# Provides Strong Exception Handling Features which can be used to stop the Abnormal Termination of the program and you can also provide user-understandable messages when an exception is raised.

### C# Definition based on the above features:
**C# is just a Simple, Secure, Robust, Portable, Platform-Independent, Architectural Neutral, Multithreaded, Automatic Memory Management, Object-Oriented Programming Language with a strong type Exception Handling mechanism for developing different kinds of applications such as Web, Windows Form, Console, Web Services, Mobile Apps, etc. which can be run on different Operating Systems such as Windows, Linus, and Mac.**

## Features of C#
Although C# constructs closely follow traditional high-level languages, C and C++ and being an object-oriented programming languages. It has a strong resemblance with Java, it has numerous strong programming features that make it endearing to a number of programmers worldwide. Following is the list of a few important features of C#:
1. **Simple**: C# is a simple language in the sense that it provides a structured approach (to break the problem into parts), a rich set of library functions, data types, etc.
2. **Modern Programming Language**: C# programming is based upon the current trend and it is very powerful and simple for building scalable, interoperable, and robust applications.
3. **Object-Oriented**: C# is an object-oriented programming language. OOPs makes development and maintenance easier whereas in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as the project size grows.
4. **Type-Safe**: C# type safe code can only access the memory location that it has permission to execute. Therefore, it improves the security of the program.
5. **Interoperability**: The interoperability process enables the C# programs to do almost anything that a native C++ application can do.
6. **Scalable and Updateable**: C# is an automatic scalable and updateable programming language. For updating our application, we delete the old files and update them with new ones.
7. **Component Oriented**: C# is a component-oriented programming language. It is the predominant software development methodology used to develop more robust and highly scalable applications.
8. **Structured Programming Language**: C# is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify.
9. **Rich Library**: C# provides a lot of inbuilt functions that make development fast.
10. **Fast Speed**: The compilation and execution time of the C# language is fast.

## Types of Applications Developed using C#:
With the help of the C# programming language, we can develop different types of secured and robust applications:
1. **Window applications**
2. **Web applications**
3. **Distributed applications**
4. **Web service applications**
5. **Database applications**
6. **Mobile Applications, etc**

## What can C# do for us?
Well, the answer is, a lot. I would say, nearly anything. C# can be used to write Windows clients Applications, Web applications, Mobile Apps, Enterprise Software, Backend, and Service-Oriented Applications. The following image demonstrates the C# world and applications ecosystem. The following image demonstrates the C# world and applications ecosystem.
