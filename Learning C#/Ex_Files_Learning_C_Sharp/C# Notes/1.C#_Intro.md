# Algorithm, Pseudocode, Programs, and Flowcharts
## Pseudocode:
Is an artificial and informal language that helps programmers in developing algorithms. It is basically a way to write code in words.

## Algorithm: 
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a computational problem. It is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.

First, let's learn a few analytical or problem-solving skills to write an algorithm.

**Example:**
* Let’s consider a chef who knows how to prepare a dish then he/she can easily prepare the recipe of that dish.
* Let’s consider a chemist who is well versed with different chemical reactions then he/she can easily prepare a chemical formula applying those reactions.

Once an algorithm is prepared, we need to convert it into a Program so that the computer can execute it and perform the computational task. Any programming language can be used to write a program but it must strictly follow the syntax of that programming language.

## Program:
A program is a step-by-step machine instruction used for solving any problem or computational task.

## Algorithm and Program Example:

### Let us Understand the Algorithm.
The Algorithm is for finding the average of the list of elements. That is, we have a collection of elements and we want to find out the average. First, we assign 0 to Sum. Then for each element x in the list, we begin sum assigned sum+ x i.e. adding each value of x into the sum variable. Then after that, the average is assigned sum by the number of elements, and then, return the average. So, if you read the above algorithm, you can understand how to find the average of a list of elements. Add all of them and divide by the number of elements. That’s it. This is how we write our algorithm using pseudocode.

### Let us Understand the Program.
Now the same thing for finding the average list of elements, we have written the program using C++ language. It’s a function, it’s not a complete program, just a function inside a program. If we don’t use a semicolon to end the statement, it’s an error, and instead of assignment if we write less than or a hyphen symbol, then also it is an error. So, if you want to store the value then you must use an equal symbol and that is called an assignment.

So, it means you should follow the proper syntax of a language. Because this is not for you. You are writing the program for the compiler to understand and convert it into machine code. You will write a C++ program and that gets converted into machine code or machine language. So, you are actually talking to the compiler. You should talk in such a way that you can easily understand.

If the compiler is not understanding your program, then the compiler cannot convert your program into machine code. So, you should follow the syntax perfectly. That is the reason you have to put some little extra effort into learning programming.

## What is a Flowchart?
A flowchart is used for showing the flow of control in a program and the sequence of steps involved in a hierarchical manner. It is basically a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, workflow, or process.

So, if a program is very big then it is very difficult to figure out how the flow of the program is, Flow charts are useful for understanding the program, instead of one is reading the program and understanding it, he can see the flow chart and understand how the program is working.

It is just like if you talk about electrical wiring in a home. Then from where the wires or the cables are moving through the walls. If you have a plan then you can know where exactly they are flowing and where the important points are, everything you can know. Otherwise, if there is any problem with the wiring, then you have to dig the whole wall to find out the problem. If there is a proper plan then you can understand. So before laying the wire or pulling the wires we will make a plan. In the same way, before writing the program we make a flowchart. So based on the flow chart we will write the program. This will help us to understand the program.

### Steps in the flowchart:
Usually, when we are using a flow chart for the program, it consists of three steps:
* Input
* Process
* Output

First, it takes some input. Then it will process. Then it will give the output. So, any procedure you take will have similar steps. For example, preparing a dish. 
1. Input is the ingredients. 
2. That process is the process of making a dish  
3. The output is the dish ready. 

If you take a chemistry experiment that is done usually in laboratories will have input means chemicals and the vessels or instruments whatever you need. Then the process of what you will do with that and then it gets done successfully. So, every procedure will have these 3 things and the program is also used to look like this.

### Elements of Flowchart:
Now let us look at the elements of the flow chart. The following image shows the different elements of a flowchart.


**Terminal:** The oval symbol indicates Start, Stop and Halt in a program’s logic flow. A pause/halt is generally used in programming logic under some error conditions. The terminal is the first and last symbol in the flowchart.

*Step 1:* Start.
*Step 2:* Declare variables Number1 and Number2.
*Step 3:* Read values Number1 and Number2.
*Step 4:* Add Number1 and Number2 and store the result in Sum. (Sum = Number1 + Number2).
*Step 5:* Display Sum.
*Step 6:* Stop.

# Introduction to .NET Framework
As a C#/.NET developer it's important to know the history behind the evolution of DOT NET Framework. Beofre DOT NET, there was COM.

## What is COM?
**COM** stands for **Component Object Model**. The COM is one of the Microsoft Frameworks. Using this Framework, we can develop **Windows Applications** (Desktop or Standalone Applications for Windows OS) as well as Web Applications. In earlier COM, **VB** is the programming language that is used to implement Windows applications and **ASP** is the technology used to implement web applications.

## What are the disadvantages of COM?
There are two major disadvantages of the COM Framework. They are as follows:

1. Incomplete Object-Oriented Programming means it will not support all the features of OOPs.
2. Platform Dependent means COM applications can run on only Windows OS.

To overcome the above problems, Microsoft introduces **.NET Framework**.

## What does .NET Represent?
**NET** stands for **Network Enabled Technology** (Internet). In .NET, dot (.) refers to **Object-Oriented**, and NET refers to the internet. So, the complete .NET means through Object-Oriented we can implement internet-based applications.

According to Microsoft, **.NET** is a **Free**, **Cross-Platform**, **Open-Source** developer platform for building many different types of applications. With .NET, we can use multiple languages (C#, VB, F#, etc.), Editors (Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio for Mac, OmniSharp, JetBrains Rider, etc), and Libraries to build for Web, Mobile, Desktop, Games, IoT, and more.

**Cross Platform**: Whether you are working in C#, F#, or Visual Basic, your code will run on any compatible operating system. You can build many types of apps with .NET. Some are Cross-Platform, and some target a specific set of operating systems and devices.

**Libraries**: To extend functionality, Microsoft and others maintain a healthy .NET package ecosystem. **NuGet** is a package manager built specifically for .NET that contains over 100,000 packages.

## What is a Framework?
A framework is a software. Or you can say a framework is a collection of many small technologies integrated together to develop applications that can be executed anywhere.

### What does the .NET Framework Provide?

The DOT NET Framework provides two things as follows:
1. BCL (Base Class Libraries)
2. CLR (Common Language Runtime)

## What is BCL?
Base Class Libraries (BCL) are designed by Microsoft. Without BCL we can’t write any code in .NET. So, BCL is also known as the basic building block of .NET Programs. These are installed into the machine when we installed the .NET framework. BCL contains pre-defined classes and these classes are used for the purpose of application development.

The physical location of BCL is **C:\Windows\assembly**

## What is CLR?
CLR stands for Common Language Runtime and it is the core component under the .NET framework which is responsible for converting the MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) code into native code.

### In the .NET framework, the code is compiled twice.
1. In the 1st compilation, the source code is compiled by the respective language compiler and generates the intermediate code which is known as **MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language)** or **IL (Intermediate language code)**, or **Managed Code**.
2. In the 2nd compilation, **MSIL** is converted into **Native code** (native code means code specific to the Operating system so that the code is executed by the Operating System) and this is done by **CLR**.
Always 1st compilation is slow and 2nd compilation is fast.

### What is JIT?
JIT stands for the **Just-in-Time** compiler. It is the component of **CLR** that is responsible for converting **MSIL** code into **Native Code**. Native code is code that is directly understandable by the operating system.

### Different types of .NET Framework
The .NET framework is available in three different flavors
1. **.NET Framework**: .NET Framework is the original implementation of .NET. It supports running websites, services, desktop applications, and more on Windows OS Only.
2. **.NET**: .NET is a cross-platform implementation for running websites, services, and console applications on Windows, Linux, and macOS. **.NET is open source** on GitHub and .NET was previously called **.NET Core**.
3. **Xamarin/Mono**: Xamarin/Mono is a .NET implementation for running apps on all the major mobile operating systems, including iOS and Android.

**Note: .NET Framework** is **Platform-Dependent** while **.NET** or **.NET Core** is **Platform Independent**. Here, we are not talking about Web Applications. Web Applications are independent of Operating Systems.

## What is not .NET?
1. .NET is not an Operating system.
2. .NET is not a database
3. It is not an ERP application.
4. NET is not a Testing Tool.
5. It is not a programming language.

## What is Exactly .NET?
.NET is a framework tool that supports many programming languages and many technologies. .NET support 60+ programming languages. Of 60+ programming languages, 9 are designed by Microsoft and the remaining are designed by non-Microsoft. Microsoft-designed programming languages are as follows:
1. **VB.NET**
2. **C#.NET**
3. **VC++.NET**
4. **J#.NET**
5. **F#.NET**
6. **Jscript.NET**
7. **WindowsPowerShell**
8. **Iron phyton**
9. **Iron Ruby**

Technologies supported by the .NET framework are as follows:
1. **ASP.NET (Active Server Pages.NET)** – MVC, Web API, Core MVC, Core Web API, Core Blazor, etc.
2. **ADO.NET** (Active Data Object.NET)
3. **WCF** (Windows Communication Foundation)
4. **WPF** (Windows Presentation Foundation)
5. **WWF** (Windows Workflow Foundation)
6. **AJAX** (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
7. **LINQ** (Language Integrated Query)
8. **Entity** Framework

## What are a Language and its need?
1. Language acts as the mediator between the programmer and the system.
2. It offers some rules and regulations for writing the program.
3. The language also offers some libraries which are required for writing the program.

## What are Technology and its Needs?
Technology is always designed for a particular purpose. For example, the development of web-related applications in .NET using the technology ASP.NET. But the technology does not offer any specific rules for writing the programs. That’s why technology can’t be implemented individually. VB.NET, C#.NET, and F#.NET are programming languages. Using any of these languages we can implement windows/desktop applications individually. Every language is having its own compiler
