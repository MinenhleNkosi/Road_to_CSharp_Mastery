# Introduction to .NET Framework.

## What is COM?
**COM** stands for **Component Object Model**. The COM is one of the Microsoft Frameworks. Using this Framework, we can develop **Windows Applications** (Desktop or Standalone Applications for Windows OS) as well as **Web Applications**. In earlier COM, **VB** is the programming language that is used to implement Windows applications and **ASP** is the technology used to implement web applications.

### What are the disadvantages of COM?
There are two major disadvantages of the COM Framework. They are as follows:
1. Incomplete Object-Oriented Programming means it will not support all the features of OOPs.
2. Platform Dependent means COM applications can run on only Windows OS.

To overcome the above problems, Microsoft introduces **.NET Framework**.

## What does .NET Represent?
**NET** stands for **Network Enabled Technology** (Internet). In .NET, dot (.) refers to **Object-Oriented**, and NET refers to the internet. So, the complete .NET means through Object-Oriented we can implement internet-based applications.

According to Microsoft, **.NET** is a **Free**, **Cross-Platform**, **Open-Source** developer platform for building many different types of applications. With .NET, we can use multiple languages (C#, VB, F#, etc.), Editors (Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio for Mac, OmniSharp, JetBrains Rider, etc), and Libraries to build for Web, Mobile, Desktop, Games, IoT, and more.

**Cross Platform**: Whether you are working in C#, F#, or Visual Basic, your code will run on any compatible operating system. You can build many types of apps with .NET. Some are Cross-Platform, and some target a specific set of operating systems and devices.

**Libraries**: To extend functionality, Microsoft and others maintain a healthy .NET package ecosystem. NuGet is a package manager built specifically for .NET that contains over 100,000 packages.

## What is a Framework?
A framework is a software. Or you can say a framework is a collection of many small technologies integrated together to develop applications that can be executed anywhere.

## What does the .NET Framework Provide?
The DOT NET Framework provides two things as follows

1. **BCL** (Base Class Libraries)
2. **CLR** (Common Language Runtime)

### What is BCL?
Base Class Libraries (BCL) are designed by Microsoft. Without BCL we can’t write any code in .NET. So, BCL is also known as the basic building block of .NET Programs. These are installed into the machine when we installed the .NET framework. BCL contains pre-defined classes and these classes are used for the purpose of application development.

The physical location of BCL is **C:\Windows\assembly**

### What is CLR?
CLR stands for Common Language Runtime and it is the core component under the .NET framework which is responsible for converting the MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) code into native code.

**In the .NET framework, the code is compiled twice.**
1. In the 1st compilation, the source code is compiled by the respective language compiler and generates the intermediate code which is known as **MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language)** or **IL (Intermediate language code)**, or **Managed Code**.
2. In the 2nd compilation, **MSIL** is converted into **Native code** (native code means code specific to the Operating system so that the code is executed by the Operating System) and this is done by **CLR**.

Always 1st compilation is slow and 2nd compilation is fast.

### What is JIT?
**JIT** stands for the **Just-in-Time** compiler. It is the component of **CLR** that is responsible for converting **MSIL** code into **Native Code**. Native code is code that is directly understandable by the operating system.

### What is not .NET?
1. .NET is not an Operating system.
2. .NET is not a database
3. It is not an ERP application.
4. .NET is not a Testing Tool.
5. It is not a programming language.

## What is Exactly .NET?
.NET is a framework tool that supports many programming languages and many technologies. .NET support 60+ programming languages. Of 60+ programming languages, 9 are designed by Microsoft and the remaining are designed by non-Microsoft. Microsoft-designed programming languages are as follows:
1. **VB.NET**
2. **C#.NET**
3. **VC++.NET**
4. **J#.NET**
5. **F#.NET**
6. **Jscript.NET**
7. **WindowsPowerShell**
8. **Iron phyton**
9. **Iron Ruby**

**Technologies supported by the .NET framework are as follows**
1. **ASP.NET (Active Server Pages.NET)** – MVC, Web API, Core MVC, Core Web API, Core Blazor, etc.
2. **ADO.NET** (Active Data Object.NET)
3. **WCF** (Windows Communication Foundation)
4. **WPF** (Windows Presentation Foundation)
5. **WWF** (Windows Workflow Foundation)
6. **AJAX** (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
7. **LINQ** (Language Integrated Query)
8. **Entity** Framework

## What are a Language and its need?
1. Language acts as the mediator between the programmer and the system.
2. It offers some rules and regulations for writing the program.
3. The language also offers some libraries which are required for writing the program.

## What are Technology and its Needs?
Technology is always designed for a particular purpose. For example, the development of web-related applications in .NET using the technology ASP.NET. But the technology does not offer any specific rules for writing the programs. That’s why technology can’t be implemented individually. VB.NET, C#.NET, and F#.NET are programming languages. Using any of these languages we can implement windows/desktop applications individually. Every language is having its own compiler.
