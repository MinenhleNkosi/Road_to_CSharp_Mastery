# Migration in EF 6 Code-First
Entity Framework Code-First had different database initialization strategies like CreateDatabaseIfNotExists, DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges, and DropCreateDatabaseAlways. However, there are some problems with these strategies, for example if you already have data (other than seed data) or existing Stored Procedures, triggers etc. in your database. These strategies used to drop the entire database and recreate it, so you would lose the data and other DB objects.

Entity Framework introduced a migration tool that automatically updates the database schema when your model changes without losing any existing data or other database objects. It uses a new database initializer called **MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion**.

There are two kinds of Migration:
1. Automated Migration
2. Code-based Migration

## Automated Migration in Entity Framework 6
Entity Framework introduced automated migration so that you don't have to process database migration manually for each change you make in your domain classes.

The automated migrations can be implemented by executing the `enable-migrations` command in the Package Manager Console. Open the Package Manager Console from Tools → Library Package Manager → Package Manager Console and then run the `enable-migrations –EnableAutomaticMigration:$true` command (make sure that the default project is the project where your context class is).

Once the command runs successfully, it creates an internal sealed `Configuration` class derived from `DbMigrationConfiguration` in the Migration folder in your project:

![pic](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/images/codefirst/automated-migration2.PNG)

As you can see in the constructor of the `Configuration` class, `AutomaticMigrationsEnabled` is set to true.

The next step is to set the database initializer in the context class to `MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion`, as shown below:

```cs
public class SchoolContext: DbContext 
{
    public SchoolDBContext(): base("SchoolDB") 
    {
        Database.SetInitializer(new MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion<SchoolDBContext, EF6Console.Migrations.Configuration>());
    }

    public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
        
    protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
    }
}
```

Now, you are all set for automated migration. EF will automatically take care of the migration when you change the domain classes. As of now, we only have the Student entity as per the SchoolContext class above. Run the application and look at the created database:

![pic](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/images/codefirst/automated-migration3.PNG)

You will find that EF API created a system table `__MigrationHistory` along with the `Students` table. The `__MigrationHistory` table contains the history of database changes for all the migrations.

Now, you can add new domain classes and when you run the application again and you will see that the database contains tables for all entities automatically. You don't need to run any command.

However, this works only if you add new domain classes or remove classes, but it won't work when you add, modify or remove properties in the domain classes. To do this, remove any property from any domain class and run the application. You will get the following exception.

![pic](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/images/codefirst/automated-migration-fg5.PNG)

This is because you will lose data in the corresponding column of a property. So, to handle this kind of scenario, you have to set `AutomaticMigrationDataLossAllowed` to true in the `Configuration` class constructor, along with `AutomaticMigrationsEnabled = true;`.

DESCRIPTION
    Enables Migrations by scaffolding a migrations configuration class in the project. If the
    target database was created by an initializer, an initial migration will be created (unless
    automatic migrations are enabled via the EnableAutomaticMigrations parameter).

## Code-Based Migration in Entity Framework 6
In the previous chapter, you learned about automated migration which automatically updates the database schema when you change domain classes. Here, you will learn about code-based migration.

The code-based migration provides more control on the migration and allows you to configure additional things such as setting a default value of a column, configure a computed column etc.

In order to use code-based migration, you need to execute the following commands in the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio:
1. **Enable-Migrations:** Enables the migration in your project by creating a `Configuration` class.
2. **Add-Migration:** Creates a new migration class as per specified name with the `Up()` and `Down()` methods.
3. **Update-Database:** Executes the last migration file created by the `Add-Migration` command and applies changes to the database schema.

To use code-based migrations, first execute the `enable-migrations` command in the Package Manager Console. Open the Package Manager Console from Tools → Library Package Manager → Package Manager Console and then run the `enable-migrations` command (make sure that the default project is the project where your context class is).

![pic](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/Images/codefirst/codebased2.PNG)

The `Enable-Migrations` command will create the `Configuration` class derived from `DbMigrationsConfiguration` with `AutomaticMigrationsEnabled = false`.

Now, you need to set the database initializer `MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion` in your context class, as shown below:

```cs
public class SchoolContext: DbContext 
{
    public SchoolDBContext(): base("SchoolDB") 
    {
        Database.SetInitializer(new MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion<SchoolDBContext, EF6Console.Migrations.Configuration>());
    }

    public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
        
    protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {

    }
}
```
Now, you have to create a migration class using the `Add-Migration` command with the name of your migration class, as shown below:

![pic](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/images/codefirst/codebased1.PNG)

The above command will create a `<timestamp>_SchoolDB-v1.cs` file with the `Up()` and `Down()` methods, as shown below:

![pic](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/images/codefirst/codebased3.PNG)

As you can see, the `Up()` method contains code for creating database objects and the `Down()` method contains code for dropping or deleting database objects. You may also write your own custom code for additional configurations. This is the advantage over automated migration.

To know more about `add-migration` command parameters, execute `get-help add-migration` or `get-help add-migration -detailed` commands in PMC, as shown below:

```cs
PM> get-help add-migration

        [-IgnoreChanges] [-AppDomainBaseDirectory <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

After creating a migration file using the add-migration command, you have to update the database. Execute the `Update-Database` command to create or modify a database schema. Use the `–verbose` option to view the SQL statements being applied to the target database.

```cs
PM> get-help update-database

    Update-Database
    
SYNOPSIS
    Applies any pending migrations to the database.
    
    
SYNTAX
    Update-Database [-SourceMigration <String>] [-TargetMigration <String>] [-Script] [-Force]

```
At this point, the database will be created or updated. Now, whenever you change the domain classes, execute `Add-Migration` with the name parameter to create a new migration file and then execute the `Update-Database` command to apply the changes to the database schema.

### Rollback Migration
Suppose you want to roll back the database schema to any of the previous states, then you can execute the `update-database` command with the `–TargetMigration` parameter to the point which you want to roll back to. For example, suppose there are many migrations applied to the above SchoolDB database but you want to roll back to the first migration. Then execute the following command.

`PM> update-database -TargetMigration:SchoolDB-v1`
