# Configure One-to-Zero-or-One Relationship in Entity Framework 6
Here, you will learn to configure One-to-Zero-or-One relationships between two entities.

We will implement a one-to-Zero-or-One relationship between the following `Student` and `StudentAddress` entities.

```cs
public class Student
{
    public int StudentId { get; set; }
    public string StudentName { get; set; }

    public virtual StudentAddress Address { get; set; }
}
     
public class StudentAddress 
{
    public int StudentAddressId { get; set; }
    public string Address1 { get; set; }
    public string Address2 { get; set; }
    public string City { get; set; }
    public int Zipcode { get; set; }
    public string State { get; set; }
    public string Country { get; set; }

    public virtual Student Student { get; set; }
}
```

Visit the ![Entity Relationship](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/entity-relationships.aspx) section to understand how EF manages one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

A one-to-zero-or-one relationship happens when a primary key of one table becomes PK & FK in another table in a relational database such as SQL Server. So, we need to configure the above entities in such a way that EF creates the `Students` and `StudentAddresses` tables in the DB and makes the `StudentId` column in `Student` table as PrimaryKey (PK) and `StudentAddressId` column in the `StudentAddresses` table as PK and ForeignKey (FK) both.

## Configure One-to-Zero-or-One Relationship using Data Annotation Attributes
Here, we will apply data annotation attributes on the `Student` and `StudentAddress` entities to establish a one-to-zero-or-one relationship.

The `Student` entity follows the default ![code-first convention](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/code-first/code-first-conventions.aspx) as it includes the `StudentId` property which will be the key property. So, we don't need to apply any attributes on it because EF will make the `StudentId` column as a PrimaryKey in the `Students` table in the database.

For the `StudentAddress` entity, we need to configure the `StudentAddressId` as PK & FK both. The `StudentAddressId` property follows the default convention for primary key. So, we don't need to apply any attribute for PK. However, we also need to make it a foreign key which points to `StudentId` of the `Student` entity. So, apply `[ForeignKey("Student")]` on the `StudentAddressId` property which will make it a foreign key for the `Student` entity, as shown below:

```cs
public class Student
{
    public int StudentId { get; set; }
    public string StudentName { get; set; }

    public virtual StudentAddress Address { get; set; }
}
     
public class StudentAddress 
{
    [ForeignKey("Student")]
    public int StudentAddressId { get; set; }
        
    public string Address1 { get; set; }
    public string Address2 { get; set; }
    public string City { get; set; }
    public int Zipcode { get; set; }
    public string State { get; set; }
    public string Country { get; set; }

    public virtual Student Student { get; set; }
}
```
Thus, you can use data annotation attributes to configure a one-to-zero-or-one relationship between two entities.

**Note:** `Student` includes the `StudentAddress` navigation property and `StudentAddress` includes the `Student` navigation property. With the one-to-zero-or-one relationship, a `Student` can be saved without `StudentAddress` but the `StudentAddress` entity cannot be saved without the `Student` entity. EF will throw an exception if you try to save the `StudentAddress` entity without the `Student` entity.

## Configure a One-to-Zero-or-One relationship using Fluent API
Here, we will use Fluent API to configure a one-to-zero-or-one relationship between the `Student` and `StudentAddress` entities.
The following example sets a one-to-zero or one relationship between `Student` and `StudentAddress` using Fluent API.

```cs
protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    // Configure Student & StudentAddress entity
    modelBuilder.Entity<Student>()
                .HasOptional(s => s.Address) // Mark Address property optional in Student entity
                .WithRequired(ad => ad.Student); // mark Student property as required in StudentAddress entity. Cannot save StudentAddress without Student
}
```
In the above example, we start with the `Student` entity. The `HasOptional()` method configures the `Address` navigation property in `Student` entity as optional (not required when saving the `Student` entity). Then, the `WithRequired()` method makes the `Student` navigation property of `StudentAddress` as required (required when saving the `StudentAddress` entity; it will throw an exception when the `StudentAddress` entity is saved without the `Student` navigation property). This will also make the `StudentAddressId` as ForeignKey.

Thus, you can configure a one-to-Zero-or-one relationship between two entities where the `Student` entity can be saved without attaching the `StudentAddress` object to it but the `StudentAddress` entity cannot be saved without attaching an object of the `Student` entity. This makes one end required.
EF API will create the following tables in the database.

## Configure a One-to-One relationship using Fluent API
We can configure a one-to-One relationship between entities using Fluent API where both ends are required, meaning that the `Student` entity object must include the `StudentAddress` entity object and the `StudentAddress` entity must include the `Student` entity object in order to save it.

**Note:** One-to-one relationships are technically not possible in MS SQL Server. These will always be one-to-zero-or-one relationships. EF forms One-to-One relationships on entities not in the DB.

```cs
protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    // Configure StudentId as FK for StudentAddress
    modelBuilder.Entity<Student>()
                .HasRequired(s => s.Address) 
                .WithRequiredPrincipal(ad => ad.Student); 

}
```
In the above example, `modelBuilder.Entity<Student>().HasRequired(s => s.Address)` makes the `Address` property of `StudentAddress` as required and `.WithRequiredPrincipal(ad => ad.Student)` makes the `Student` property of the `StudentAddress` entity as required. Thus it configures both ends as required. So now, when you try to save the `Student` entity without the `StudentAddress` entity without the `Student`, it will throw an exception.

Create a read-only Entity Data Model for the above example using ![EF Power Tools](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/code-first/entity-framework-power-tools.aspx). The entities will appear like the diagram shown below:
