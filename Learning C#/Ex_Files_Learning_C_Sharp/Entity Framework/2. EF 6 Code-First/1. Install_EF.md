# What is Code-First?
Entity Framework introduced the Code-First approach with Entity Framework 4.1. Code-First is mainly useful in **Domain Driven Design**. In the Code-First approach, you focus on the domain of your application and start creating classes for your domain entity rather than design your database first and then create the classes which match your database design. The following figure illustrates the code-first approach.

As you can see in the above figure, EF API will create the database based on your domain classes and configuration. This means you need to start coding first in C# or VB.NET and then EF will create the database from your code.

## Code-First Workflow
The following figure illustrates the code-first development workflow.

The development workflow in the code-first approach would be: Create or modify domain classes -> configure these domain classes using Fluent-API or data annotation attributes -> Create or update the database schema using automated migration or code-based migration.


# Simple Code-First Example
## EF Code-First Example
Let's assume that we want to create a simple application for XYZ School. Users of this School application should be able to add and update students, grades, teachers, and courses information.

Instead of designing database tables first, let's start creating classes for our school domain, as and when needed. First, create the `Student` and `Grade` classes where every `Student` is associated with one `Grade` as shown below. This is called a one-to-many relationship. Learn about how EF manages the relationship between entities (domain classes) ![here](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/entity-relationships.aspx).

```cs
public class Student
{
    public int StudentID { get; set; }
    public string StudentName { get; set; }
    public DateTime? DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public byte[]  Photo { get; set; }
    public decimal Height { get; set; }
    public float Weight { get; set; }
        
    public Grade Grade { get; set; }
}
```

Create the `Grade` class as shown below.

```cs
public class Grade
{
    public int GradeId { get; set; }
    public string GradeName { get; set; }
    public string Section { get; set; }
    
    public ICollection<Student> Students { get; set; }
}
```

Now, we are done with the initial domain classes for our school application.

The Code-First approach also requires a ![context class](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/basics/context-class-in-entity-framework.aspx) which should be derived from `DbContext` class. Create a context class as shown below. It derives from `DBContext` class and exposes `DbSet` properties for the types that you want to be part of the model, e.g. `Student` and `Grade` classes in this case. The `DbSet` is a collection of entity classes (aka entity set), so we have given the property name as the plural of entity name like `Students` and `Grades`.

```cs
namespace EF6Console
{
    public class SchoolContext: DbContext 
    {
        public SchoolContext(): base()
        {
            
        }
            
        public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
        public DbSet<Grade> Grades { get; set; }
    }
}
```

Now, we are done with the required classes for the code-first approach. We will now add a student using context class as shown below.

```cs
namespace EF6Console
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
     
            using (var ctx = new SchoolContext())
            {
                var stud = new Student() { StudentName = "Bill" };
        
                ctx.Students.Add(stud);
                ctx.SaveChanges();                
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**But where is the database and which are the tables and their columns?**

This is the beauty of EF Code-First API. It creates the database based on the parameter passed in the base constructor of your context class. Since we have not passed any parameter in the constructor of our context class, it created EF6Console.SchoolContext database in the local SQLEXPRESS database, as shown below. It also created two tables in this database, Students and Grades based on the Student and the Grade domain classes defined above.

As you can see in the above figure, it has created `Students` and `Grades` tables and each table contains columns with appropriate datatype and length. The column names and datatype match the properties of the respective domain classes. It has also made StudentId and `GradeId` as PKs (**primary keys**) and created `Grade_GradeId` column as FK (**foreign key**).

This way, without creating a database first, you can start writing an application that will eventually create a database from your domain classes.

**Note:** If you modify these classes and run the application again, then it will throw the following exception.

You need to define the database initialization strategy in the context class in order to modify domain classes and run the application locally. Learn about it ![here](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/code-first/database-initialization-in-code-first.aspx).
