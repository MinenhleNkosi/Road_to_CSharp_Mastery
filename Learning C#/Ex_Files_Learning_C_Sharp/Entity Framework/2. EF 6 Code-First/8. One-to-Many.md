# Configure One-to-Many Relationships in EF 6
Here, we will learn how to configure One-to-Many relationships between two entities (domain classes) in Entity Framework 6.x using the code-first approach.

Let's configure a one-to-many relationship between the following `Student` and `Grade` entities where there can be many students in one grade.

```cs
public class Student
{
    public int StudentId { get; set; }
    public string StudentName { get; set; }
}
       
public class Grade
{
    public int GradeId { get; set; }
    public string GradeName { get; set; }
    public string Section { get; set; }
}
```
After implementing the one-to-many relationship in the above entities, the database tables for `Student` and `Grade` will look like below:

The one-to-many relationship can be configured in the following ways.
1. By following Conventions
2. By using Fluent API Configurations

## Conventions for One-to-Many Relationships
There are certain conventions in Entity Framework which if followed in entity classes (domain classes) will automatically result in a one-to-many relationship between two tables in the database. You don't need to configure anything else.

Let's look at an example of all the conventions which create a one-to-many relationship.

## Convention 1
We want to establish a one-to-many relationship between the `Student` and `Grade` entities where many students are associated with one `Grade`. It means that each `Student` entity points to a `Grade`. This can be achieved by including a reference navigation property of type `Grade` in the `Student` entity class, as shown below:

```cs
public class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Grade Grade { get; set; }
}

public class Grade
{
    public int GradeId { get; set; }
    public string GradeName { get; set; }
    public string Section { get; set; }
}
```
In the above example, the `Student` class includes a reference navigation property of `Grade` class. So, there can be many students in a single grade. This will result in a one-to-many relationship between the `Students` and `Grades` table in the database, where the `Students` table includes foreign key `Grade_GradeId` as shown below:

![pic](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/images/codefirst/onetomany-1.PNG)

Notice that the reference property is nullable, so it creates a nullable foreign key column `Grade_GradeId` in the `Students` table. You can [configure NotNull foreign key using fluent API](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/code-first/configure-one-to-many-relationship-in-code-first.aspx#notnull-foreignkey-using-fluent-api).

## Convention 2
Another convention is to include a collection navigation property in the principal entity as shown below.

```cs
public class Student
{
    public int StudentId { get; set; }
    public string StudentName { get; set; }
}

public class Grade
{
    public int GradeId { get; set; }
    public string GradeName { get; set; }
    public string Section { get; set; }

    public ICollection<Student> Students { get; set; } 
}
```
In the above example, the `Grade` entity includes a collection navigation property of type `ICollection<Student>`. This also results in a one-to-many relationship between the `Student` and `Grade` entities. This example produces the same result in the database as convention 1.

## Convention 3
Including navigation properties at both ends will also result in a one-to-many relationship, as shown below:

```cs
public class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Grade Grade { get; set; }
}

public class Grade
{
    public int GradeID { get; set; }
    public string GradeName { get; set; }
    public string Section { get; set; }
    
    public ICollection<Student> Student { get; set; }
}
```
In the above example, the `Student` entity includes a reference navigation property of the `Grade` type and the `Grade` entity class includes a collection navigation property of the `ICollection<Student>` type which results in a one-to-many relationship. This example produces the same result in the database as convention 1.

## Convention 4
A fully defined relationship at both ends will create a one-to-many relationship, as shown below:

```cs
public class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    
    public int GradeId { get; set; }
    public Grade Grade { get; set; }
}

public class Grade
{

    public int GradeId { get; set; }
    public string GradeName { get; set; }
    
    public ICollection<Student> Student { get; set; }
}
```
In the above example, the `Student` entity includes foreign key property `GradeId` with its reference property `Grade`. This will create a one-to-many relationship with the NotNull foreign key column in the `Students` table, as shown below:

![pic](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/images/codefirst/onetomany-2.PNG)

If the data type of `GradeId` is nullable integer, then it will create a null foreign key.

```cs
public class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public int? GradeId { get; set; }
    public Grade Grade { get; set; }
}
```
The above code snippet will create a nullable `GradeId` column in the database because we have used `Nullable<int>` type (`?` is a shortcut for `Nullable<int>`)

## Configure a One-to-Many Relationship using Fluent API
Generally, you don't need to configure the one-to-many relationship in entity framework because one-to-many relationship conventions cover all combinations. However, you may configure relationships using Fluent API at one place to make it more maintainable.

Consider the following `Student` and `Grade` entity classes:

```cs
public class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public int CurrentGradeId { get; set; }
    public Grade CurrentGrade { get; set; }
}

public class Grade
{
    public int GradeId { get; set; }
    public string GradeName { get; set; }
    public string Section { get; set; }

    public ICollection<Student> Students { get; set; }
}
```
You can configure a one-to-many relationship for the above entities using Fluent API by overriding the `OnModelCreating` method in the context class, as shown below:

```cs
public class SchoolContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Grade> Grades { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        // configures one-to-many relationship
        modelBuilder.Entity<Student>()
            .HasRequired<Grade>(s => s.CurrentGrade)
            .WithMany(g => g.Students)
            .HasForeignKey<int>(s => s.CurrentGradeId);          
    }
}
```
Let's understand the above code step by step.
1. First, we need to start configuring with any one entity class. So, `modelBuilder.Entity<student>()` starts with the `Student` entity.
2. Then, `.HasRequired<Grade>(s => s.CurrentGrade)` specifies that the `Student` entity has required the `CurrentGrade` property. This will create a NotNull foreign key column in the DB.
3. Now, it's time to configure the other end of the relationship - the `Grade` entity.
4. `.WithMany(g => g.Students)` specifies that the `Grade` entity class includes many `Student` entities. Here, many infers the `ICollection` type property.
5. Now, if the `Student` entity does not follow the Id property convention for foreign key, then we can specify the name of the foreign key using the `HasForeignKey` method.
6. `.HasForeignKey<int>(s => s.CurrentGradeId);` specifies the foreign key property in the Student entity.

Alternatively, you can start configuring the relationship with the `Grade` entity instead of the `Student` entity. The following code produces the same result as above:

```cs
modelBuilder.Entity<Grade>()
    .HasMany<Student>(g => g.Students)
    .WithRequired(s => s.CurrentGrade)
    .HasForeignKey<int>(s => s.CurrentGradeId);
```
The above example will create the following tables in the database:

## Configure the NotNull ForeignKey using Fluent API
In convention 1, we have seen that it creates an optional one-to-many relationship which in turn creates a nullable foreign key column in the database. To make it a NotNull column, use the `HasRequired()` method as shown below:

```cs
modelBuilder.Entity<Student>()
    .HasRequired<Grade>(s => s.CurrentGrade)
    .WithMany(g => g.Students);
```

## Configure Cascade Delete using Fluent API
Cascade delete means automatically deleting child rows when the related parent row is deleted. For example, if `Grade` is deleted then all the students in that `Grade` should also be deleted automatically. The following code configures the cascade delete using the `WillCascadeOnDelete` method.

```cs
modelBuilder.Entity<Grade>()
    .HasMany<Student>(g => g.Students)
    .WithRequired(s => s.CurrentGrade)
    .WillCascadeOnDelete();
```
