# Configure Many-to-Many Relationships in Code-First
Here, we will learn how to configure a Many-to-Many relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entity classes. `Student` can join multiple courses and multiple students can join one `Course`.

Visit the ![Entity Relationship](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/entity-relationships.aspx) chapter to understand how EF manages one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between entities.

## Many-to-Many Relationship by Following Conventions
EF 6 includes default conventions for many-to-many relationships. You need to include a collection navigation property at both ends. For example, the `Student` class should have a collection navigation property of `Course` type, and the `Course` class should have a collection navigation property of `Student` type to create a many-to-many relationship between them without any configuration, as shown below:

```cs
public class Student
{
    public Student() 
    {
        this.Courses = new HashSet<Course>();
    }

    public int StudentId { get; set; }
    [Required]
    public string StudentName { get; set; }

    public virtual ICollection<Course> Courses { get; set; }
}
        
public class Course
{
    public Course()
    {
        this.Students = new HashSet<Student>();
    }

    public int CourseId { get; set; }
    public string CourseName { get; set; }

    public virtual ICollection<Student> Students { get; set; }
}
```

The following is the context class that includes the `Student` and `Course` entities.

```cs
public class SchoolDBContext : DBContext
{
    public SchoolDBContext() : base("SchoolDB-DataAnnotations")
    {
    }

    public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Course> Courses { get; set; }
        
    protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
    }
}
```
EF API will create `Students`, `Courses` and also the joining table `StudentCourses` in the database for the above example. The `StudentCourses` table will include the PK (Primary Key) of both tables - `Student_StudentId` & `Course_CourseId`, as shown below:

**Note:** EF automatically creates a joining table with the name of the both entities and the suffix 's'.

## Configure a Many-to-Many Relationship using Fluent API
As you have seen above, the default conventions for many-to-many relationships creates a joining table with the default naming conventions. Use Fluent API to customize a joining table name and column names, as shown below:

```cs
protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{

    modelBuilder.Entity<Student>()
                .HasMany<Course>(s => s.Courses)
                .WithMany(c => c.Students)
                .Map(cs =>
                        {
                            cs.MapLeftKey("StudentRefId");
                            cs.MapRightKey("CourseRefId");
                            cs.ToTable("StudentCourse");
                        });

}
```
In the above example, the `HasMany()` and `WithMany()` methods are used to configure a many-to-many relationship between the `Student` and `Course` entities. The `Map()` method takes Action type delegate, hence, we can pass the lambda expression to customize column names in a joining table. We can specify the PK property name of `Student` in `MapLeftKey()` (we started with the `Student` entity, so it will be the left table) and the PK of the `Course` table in `MapRightKey()` method. The `ToTable()` method specifies the name of a joining table (`StudentCourse` in this case).

The above code will create a joining table `StudentCourse` with two Primary Keys `StudentRefId` and `CourseRefId` which will also be Foreign Keys, as shown below:

In this way, you can override the default conventions for many-to-many relationship and customize a joining table name and its columns.
