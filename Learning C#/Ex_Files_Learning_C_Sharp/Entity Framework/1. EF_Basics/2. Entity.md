# What is an Entity in Entity Framework?
An entity in Entity Framework is a class that maps to a database table. This class must be included as a `DbSet<TEntity>` type property in the `DbContext` class. EF API maps each entity to a table and each property of an entity to a column in the database.

For example, the following `Student`, and `Grade` are domain classes in the school application.

```cs
public class Student
{
    public int StudentID { get; set; }
    public string StudentName { get; set; }
    public DateTime? DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public byte[]  Photo { get; set; }
    public decimal Height { get; set; }
    public float Weight { get; set; }
        
    public Grade Grade { get; set; }
}

public class Grade
{
    public int GradeId { get; set; }
    public string GradeName { get; set; }
    public string Section { get; set; }

    public ICollection<Student> Students { get; set; }
} 
```

The above classes become entities when they are included as `DbSet<TEntity>` properties in a context class (the class which derives from `DbContext`), as shown below:

```cs
public class SchoolContext : DbContext
{
    public SchoolContext()
    {

    }

    public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Grade> Grades { get; set; }
}
```

In the above context class, `Students`, and `Grades` properties of type `DbSet<TEntity>` are called entity sets. The `Student`, and `Grade` are entities. EF API will create the `Students` and `Grades` tables in the database, as shown below.

An Entity can include two types of properties: Scalar Properties and Navigation Properties.

Scalar Property
The primitive type properties are called scalar properties. Each scalar property maps to a column in the database table which stores an actual data. For example, `StudentID`, `StudentName`, `DateOfBirth`, `Photo`, `Height`, `Weight` are the scalar properties in the `Student` entity class.

```cs
public class Student
{
    // scalar properties
    public int StudentID { get; set; }
    public string StudentName { get; set; }
    public DateTime? DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public byte[]  Photo { get; set; }
    public decimal Height { get; set; }
    public float Weight { get; set; }
        
    //reference navigation properties
    public Grade Grade { get; set; }
}
```

EF API will create a column in the database table for each scalar property, as shown below.

## Navigation Property
The navigation property represents a relationship to another entity.

There are two types of navigation properties: Reference Navigation and Collection Navigation

## Reference Navigation Property
If an entity includes a property of another entity type, it is called a Reference Navigation Property. It points to a single entity and represents multiplicity of one (1) in the entity relationships.

EF API will create a ForeignKey column in the table for the navigation properties that points to a PrimaryKey of another table in the database. For example, `Grade` are reference navigation properties in the following `Student` entity class.

```cs
public class Student
{
    // scalar properties
    public int StudentID { get; set; }
    public string StudentName { get; set; }
    public DateTime? DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public byte[]  Photo { get; set; }
    public decimal Height { get; set; }
    public float Weight { get; set; }
        
    //reference navigation property
    public Grade Grade { get; set; }
}
```

In the database, EF API will create a ForeignKey `Grade_GradeId` in the `Students` table, as shown below:

## Collection Navigation Property
If an entity includes a property of generic collection of an entity type, it is called a collection navigation property. It represents multiplicity of many (*).

EF API does not create any column for the collection navigation property in the related table of an entity, but it creates a column in the table of an entity of generic collection. For example, the following `Grade` entity contains a generic collection navigation property `ICollection<Student>`. Here, the `Student` entity is specified as generic type, so EF API will create a column `Grade_GradeId` in the `Students` table in the database.

# Types of Entities in Entity Framework
There are two types of Entities in Entity Framework: **POCO** Entities and Dynamic Proxy Entities.

## POCO Entities (Plain Old CLR Object)
A **POCO** entity is a class that doesn't depend on any framework-specific base class. It is like any other normal .NET CLR class, which is why it is called "Plain Old CLR Objects".

**POCO** entities are supported in both EF 6 and EF Core.

These **POCO** entities (also known as persistence-ignorant objects) support most of the same query, insert, update, and delete behaviors as entity types that are generated by the Entity Data Model. The following is an example of Student **POCO** entity:

```cs
public class Student
{
    public int StudentID { get; set; }
    public string StudentName { get; set; }
    public DateTime? DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public byte[]  Photo { get; set; }
    public decimal Height { get; set; }
    public float Weight { get; set; }
        
    public StudentAddress StudentAddress { get; set; }
    public Grade Grade { get; set; }
}
```

## Dynamic Proxy Entities (POCO Proxy)
Dynamic Proxy is a runtime proxy class which wraps **POCO** entity. Dynamic proxy entities allow **lazy loading**.

**Note:** Dynamic proxy entities are only supported in EF 6. EF Core 2.0 does not support them yet (by the time of making this notes).

A **POCO** entity should meet the following requirements to become a **POCO** proxy:

1. A **POCO** class must be declared with public access.
2. A **POCO** class must not be sealed (NotInheritable in Visual Basic).
3. A **POCO** class must not be abstract (MustInherit in Visual Basic).
4. Each navigation property must be declared as `public`, `virtual`.
5. Each collection property must be `ICollection<T>`.
6. The `ProxyCreationEnabled` option must NOT be `false` (default is `true`) in context class.

The following **POCO** entity meets all of the above requirements to become a dynamic proxy entity at runtime.

```cs
public class Student
{
    public int StudentID { get; set; }
    public string StudentName { get; set; }
    public DateTime? DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public byte[]  Photo { get; set; }
    public decimal Height { get; set; }
    public float Weight { get; set; }
        
    public virtual StudentAddress StudentAddress { get; set; }
    public virtual Grade Grade { get; set; }
}
```

**Note:** By default, dynamic proxy is enabled for every entity. However, you can disable dynamic proxy by setting context.Configuration.ProxyCreationEnabled = false; in the context class.

At runtime, EF API will create an instance of dynamic proxy for the above Student entity. The type of dynamic proxy for Student will be System.Data.Entity.DynamicProxies.Student, as shown below:

Use ObjectContext.GetObjectType() to find the underlying wrapped type by the dynamic proxy as shown below:

# EntityState in Entity Framework
EF API maintains the state of each entity during its lifetime. Each entity has a state based on the operation performed on it via the context class. The entity state represented by an enum `System.Data.Entity.EntityState` in EF 6 and `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.EntityState` in EF Core with the following values:
1. Added
2. Modified
3. Deleted
4. Unchanged
5. Detached

The Context not only holds the reference to all the entity objects as soon as retrieved from the database, but also keeps track of entity states and maintains modifications made to the properties of the entity. This feature is known as **Change Tracking**.

The change in entity state from the Unchanged to the Modified state is the only state that's automatically handled by the context. All other changes must be made explicitly using proper methods of `DbContext` or `DbSet`. (You will learn about these methods in EF 6 and EF Core sections.)

EF API builds and executes the **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE** commands based on the state of an entity when the `context.SaveChanges()` method is called. It executes the **INSERT** command for the entities with Added state, the **UPDATE** command for the entities with Modified state and the **DELETE** command for the entities in Deleted state. The context does not track entities in the Detached state. The following figure illustrates the significance of entity states:

Thus, entity states play an important role in Entity Framework.
