# Creating the first ASP.NET MVC Application:
First of all, open the Visual Studio and then click on the **New Project** link which appeared on the **Startup** page. An alternative approach to creating an application is to select the **File => New =>Project** option as shown in the below image.

From the New **Project** dialog window, from the left pane select the **Web** option under the **Visual C#** which is under the **“Installed – Templates”** section. From the middle pane select **ASP.NET Web Application**. Name your project as **FirstMVCApplication** (you can give any name to your application). Change the location where you want to create the application by clicking on the **Browse** button. Finally, click on the **OK** button as shown in the image below.

Once you click on the **OK** button, then a new dialog window will open with the name **New ASP.NET Web Application** for selecting the **Project Templates** . From this window select the **MVC** project template. Then Change the Authentication type to **No Authentication** . Finally, click on the **OK** button as shown in the below image.

To change the authentication, you just need to click on the **Change Authentication** button. Then it will open the following popup. From that popup select the appropriate authentication mode. As we don’t want to use any authentication for this demo, so select the **No Authentication** radio button and click on the **OK** button as shown below.

Once you click on the OK button, it will take some time to create the project for us with the following default folder structure.

## Running the ASP.NET MVC Application:
If you want to run the project **with debug** mode then just press **F5** . On the other hand, if you want to run the application **without debugging** then just Press **Ctrl + F5**. Once you run the application, it will open the following page in the browser.

The ASP.NET MVC 5 framework includes the necessary JavaScript and CSS files that are required for bootstrap by default to create a responsive web page. The responsive web page means, the looks and feels of the web page will be changed based on the screen size of the devices on which we are running the application. For example, if you run the application on a mobile device, then the top menu bar will be changed as shown in the below image.
